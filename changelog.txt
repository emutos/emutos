Start... early ages

16. May. 1985
- GEMDOS 1.0 released by Digital Research, Inc.

05. Jun. 1987  ACH	PROC.C
- Problem - After physical disk error COMMAND.PRG gives "Command not
  found." message for all subsequent external commands. Fix - Changed the
  error handling code in  xexec() to always do an ixterm(t); on any disk
  error, thus freeing memory.

26. Jun. 1987  ACH	TIME.C & BIOS
- To enable GEMDOS to take advantage of real-time clock/calendars a new
  BIOS function (11h) has been added. Whenever the BDOS sets a new time
  or date this function is called and, if the hardware supports it, the
  real-time clock can be updated. When the BDOS needs the current time or
  date the function is called to allow  the BIOS to update the internal
  BDOS values. If there is no hardware clock the BIOS can  simply ignore
  this call as the BDOS still maintains the time and date internally
  based on the system tick.

16. Sep. 1987  ACH	SUP.C
- Problem - the internal date and time variables used to time stamp file
  updates are set to 0 when the OS starts up.

  Fix - Changed cinit() in SUP.C to call new BIOS date_time() function
  (11h) so that the BIOS can initialise the internal variables from a 
  hardware real-time clock, if supported.

09. Oct. 1987 ACH	BDOSMAIN.C
- Duplicate definition of supstk and SUPSIZ removed from this module.
  (Duplicated in  PROC.C and FS.H.) If the supervisor stack is to be OEM 
  configurable some more reliable method must be devised.

19. Nov. 1987 ACH	RWA.A
- Added _lbmove, _bfill, _bmove routines. (These were supposed to be in
  something called TOOLS.ARC which was not supplied by DRI.)

01. May. 2001
- Started working on GEMDOS -> EmuTOS

28. Jul. 2001 
- Working on MFP initialization

29. Jul. 2001
- Implementing Cartridge system for work with STonX
- Rewrite of vector setup

30. Jul. 2001
- rewrote some exception handlers
- implemented VBL handler
- implemented HBL handler
- implemented keyboard interrupt handler

04. Aug. 2001 
- working on the keyboard interrupt routine

05. Aug. 2001
- got the keyboard interrupt running (wow!)

06. Aug. 2001
- got the keyboard queue running 

07. Aug. 2001
- Mega ST clock should work - could not test yet
- Character blit implemented (not tested)
- VT52 emulator implemented (not yet blitted to screen)

10. Aug. 2001
- Worked on character blitting (not tested)

11. Aug. 2001
- Got first real character blitted to screen
- cons_out is basically working 

12. Aug. 2001
- Fighting much too long against a too small supervisor stack  :-(
- Got scrolling much to slowly working

13. Aug. 2001
- scrolling now faster
- worked on keyboard decoding for bconin (not tested)
- fixed linker configuration in Makefile (libgcc forgotten)

26. Aug. 2001
- trying to bring BDOS and BIOS together

29. Aug. 2001
- integrating STonX native BIOS emulation to BIOS

02. Sep. 2001 
- found out, where the basepage is for DTA stuff

04. Sep. 2001
- got memory setup descritor working 
- got the command loading running

09. Sep. 2001
- Uppercase/lowercase is now working
- got old command.prg compiled and started and basically WORKING!!!
- command.prg: directory navigation is working

10. Sep. 2001
- handlers for showing exceptions 0x08 - 0x20 written (atari's bombs)

24. Sep. 2001
- fixed bug in supervisor stack setup (stack was top of stack + size of stack)
- Now no garbage in the diskbuffer -> clean screen while ls or dir executing

25. Sep. 2001
- os_pal changed to word width
- Implemented extended TOS 1.02 header - no basepage set in STonX any longer!
- Did put .org 0x4f2 in front of _sysbase: in tosvars.s

25. Sep. 2001 
- linea commented out of cartridge
- added .even after .ascii strings (odd exception handlers); 
- changed "dc.w 0" by '\0' at end of .ascii strings.  (rwa.s, startup.s)
- padded tosvars.s so that _sysbase == 0x4F2
- fixed (?) malloc() bug (due to missing prototype in fs.h)
- added/edited some copyright notices on top of files. (rwa.s, startup.s)

26. Sep. 2001
- change a prototype for xmgetblk - now command.prg load other programs!

30. Sep. 2001
- changed XBIOS stubs to right declaration. (MAD)

01. Oct. 2001
- ensured that the MIDI acia was inited (for KBD to work on stonc) (LVL)

05. Oct. 2001
- Makefile
- printf() clone for debug messages
- 8x16 font in high rez
- put all default exception vectors in bios/vectors.s
- clear bss before calling C code.

06. Oct. 2001
- minor bug in vectors.s
- linea stubs
- SetScrren() in xbios.c
- some malloc debug info.
- added missing util directory (MAD)
- changed sysvarend to _bssend (it is the BSS, that ends! - got from DRI)
- added end.s with _bssend 

08. Oct. 2001
- started iorec and kbdvbase stuff (aim is to reimplement kbd.c to
  be compliant with the way TOS does it)
- some debug info in Malloc(), bios(5)
<<<<<<< changelog.txt
- cleaned Makefile and end.s ("the end.s episode")

09. Oct. 2001
- Got asm conout working - MiNT did run somewhat better (MAD)
- Includes some more needed lineavars initialized (_esc_init) (MAD)
- cleaned Makefile and end.s ("the end.s episode") (LVL)
- copy paste error in linea stubs, startup.s (LVL)
