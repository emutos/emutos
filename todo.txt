- implement XBIOS calls
- implement linea functions 
- add argument specifications in function prototypes
- merge identical headers, and put them all in an include directory (?)
- cleaning function prototypes, checking compiler warnings.
- low-level floppy support (rwabs, booting a floppy)
- pexec: loaded program's memory is not released after exit
- Command.prg crashes, when commandline input is longer than line length
