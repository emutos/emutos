This is a customized EmuTOS version I play with. It's targetted specifically at stock Atari STf/STe hardware, so support from other machines or extensions is removed to make room for goodies.
Original EmuTOS aims at being perfectly TOS compatible, support as much hardware as realisticly possible, and C is prefered whenever possible over asm.
This fork aims at packing as much as possible into 256K ROM, compatibility to games/demos will be sacrificed (original ROMs are so easy to find and are perfect for that purpose), as the OS aims at being useful if the Atari is used as "main computer" for programming.

Full credits to the EmuTOS team for making great EmuTOS and for allowing such customizations.
See readme-mps.txt for more details on differences between EmuTOS and this fork.

The below is the original EmuTOS readme:

This release has been built on Linux Mint (a Ubuntu derivative), using
Vincent Rivi√®re's GCC 4.6.4 cross-compiler.  The custom tools used in
the build process were built with native GCC 4.8.4.

The source package and other binary packages are available at:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/1.0/

The extras directory (if provided) contains:
(1) one or more alternate desktop icon sets, which you can use to replace
    the builtin ones.  You can use a standard resource editor to see what
    the replacement icons look like.
    To use a replacement set, move or rename the existing emuicon.rsc &
    emuicon.def files in the root directory, then copy the files containing
    the desired icons to the root, and rename them to emuicon.rsc/emuicon.def.
(2) a sample mouse cursor set in a resource (emucurs.rsc/emucurs.def).  This
    set is the same as the builtin ones, but you can use it as a basis to
    create your own mouse cursors.
    To use a replacement set, copy the files containing the desired mouse
    cursors to the root, and rename them to emucurs.rsc/emucurs.def.
For further information on the above, see doc/emudesk.txt.
