Start... early ages

1985-05-16
- GEMDOS 1.0 released by Digital Research, Inc.

1987-06-05  ACH PROC.C
- Problem - After physical disk error COMMAND.PRG gives "Command not
  found." message for all subsequent external commands. Fix - Changed the
  error handling code in  xexec() to always do an ixterm(t); on any disk
  error, thus freeing memory.

1987-06-26  ACH TIME.C & BIOS
- To enable GEMDOS to take advantage of real-time clock/calendars a new
  BIOS function (11h) has been added. Whenever the BDOS sets a new time
  or date this function is called and, if the hardware supports it, the
  real-time clock can be updated. When the BDOS needs the current time or
  date the function is called to allow the BIOS to update the internal
  BDOS values. If there is no hardware clock the BIOS can  simply ignore
  this call as the BDOS still maintains the time and date internally
  based on the system tick.

1987-09-16  ACH SUP.C
- Problem - the internal date and time variables used to time stamp file
  updates are set to 0 when the OS starts up.

  Fix - Changed cinit() in SUP.C to call new BIOS date_time() function
  (11h) so that the BIOS can initialise the internal variables from a
  hardware real-time clock, if supported.

1987-10-09  ACH BDOSMAIN.C
- Duplicate definition of supstk and SUPSIZ removed from this module.
  (Duplicated in PROC.C and FS.H.) If the supervisor stack is to be OEM
  configurable some more reliable method must be devised.

1987-11-19  ACH RWA.A
- Added _lbmove, _bfill, _bmove routines. (These were supposed to be in
  something called TOOLS.ARC which was not supplied by DRI.)

2001-12-28
- added Falcon memconf routine (PES)
- corrected the memtop in the memconf clear routine to 14MB (PES)
- added memval3 check/set (PES)
- added ramtop/ramvalid set (no FastRAM for now) (PES)
- added run-time check for Falcon MMU that fires a bus error
  on non-Falcon machines. This makes use of stack so the notice
  in bios/startup.S about meminit not using sp is not correct (PES)
- updated status.txt (the hw init paragraph) (PES)

2001-12-31
- added FastRAM (TT-RAM) detection to bios/memory.S. Right now
  it is called if Falcon MMU was detected but generally I need
  to detect CPU type so it would work on TT as well. (PES)
- corrected // notice in bios/startup.S - the meminit actually
  needs stack pointer - for both the bus error handler and for
  occasionals bsr kprintf (PES)

- changed an explicit tab into \t in a string in command.c (LVL)
- made cvsready (LVL)

2002-01-06
- fixed BAD bug in fsmain.c - the divmod() long number (byte offset of lseek)
  was stripped when converting to (int). Due to that relocation info couldn't
  be read from a file during Pexec() and that caused "invalid exec format"
  bugs. Actually most things in BDOS filesystem could never work! (PES)
- "061a executable file format" debug print corrected: "601a ..." (PES)

2002-01-06
- optimized divmod() and moved it to bdos/fsio.c (MAD)
- did put usr2xfr/xfr2usr to bdos/fsio.c too (MAD)

  'volatile LONG frclock;' inside the routine. (LVL)
- updated fr translations (LVL)

2002-01-09
- bug now tells the number of untranslated entries in po files (LVL)
- make ikbd.dsm creates the 'gcc -S' output of file bios/ikbd.c (LVL)
- initinfo logo code rewritten: it's easier to change the picture now (LVL)
- initinfo messages displayed properly (the fore and back colors were
  not inited) - still the colors should probably be inited elsewhere (LVL)
- bell() and keyclick() now use TOS vars bell_hook and kcl_hook (LVL)
- added general block device functions in bios/blkdev.c (MAD)
- german translation updated (MAD)
- added doc/bugs.txt, entries from doc/todo.txt (MAD)

2002-01-10
- bios/floppy.c: renamed flop_hdv_boot to flop_bootcheck
                 renamed do_hdv_boot to flop_hdv_boot
                 should boot now after warmstart... (MAD)

2002-01-13
- bios/floppy.c: moved BIOS functions (rwabs, getbpb, mediach) to blkdev.c
                 moved geometry from finfo to blkdev struct
                 moved last_access to devices struct
                 moved FATfs bootsector struct to blkdev.h
                 moved compute_cksum() to blkdev.c
                 added floppy_rw() (that's the lowlevel part of floppy_rwabs)
                 added (WORD dev) to flopunlk() in order to update last_access
                 added hackish init of floppy geometry to flopini() (PES)
- bios/floppy.h: disabled bpb struct
                 made getiword externally accessible (PES)
- bios/startup.S: added ara_DMAread() (for calling the aranym's DMAread) (PES)
- bios/tosvars.h: added long recnr parameter to rwabs (like AHDI 3.0) (PES)
- bios/bios.c: added long recnr parameter to bios_4 (like AHDI 3.0) (PES)
- bios/bios.h: enabled bpb struct (PES)
- bios/xbios.c: DMAread()/DMAwrite() implemented (PES)
- Makefile: added disk.c to source files (PES)
- bios/disk.[ch] created, DMAread()/DMAwrite() implemented (PES)
- bios/blkdev.c: deleted most of Martin's framework
                 added full AHDI 3.0 extended Rwabs() (yet to add MEDIACH check)
                 added getBPB() with auto 12/16-bit FAT detection
                 added Mediach() (same as was in floppy.c) (PES)
- bios/blkdev.h: blkdev structure reworked (maybe a bit too much)
                 bpb structure disabled - what's wrong with the bios.h one?
                 UNIT and PARTITION structures - first ideas, incomplete (PES)
- Comment: the only thing I am sure of is the Rwabs() implementation. I am not
           very sure about the blkdev/device concept. Also would need to set
           common language - how to call physical drive (unit? device? drive?)
           and how to call logical disk (C:, partition, disk?). The problem
           now is how many things can be detected during boot - the size of
           partition, of the whole drive (especially with floppy) etc.
           bdos/fsio.c still strikes - passes null pointer for rwabs buffer.
           That needs to be debugged (or maybe rewritten completely). (PES)
- updated po/de.po, because of stupid translations by me (MAD)

2002-01-14
- foreground color now inited in lineainit.c (LVL)

- bios/detect.S: functions now keep register a2 intact (LVL)
- bios/kprint.c: temporarily removed console print in panic, until one
  knows of a way to be certain that the concole is configured (LVL)

  them in util/string.c and include/string.h; merged btools.h with
  string.h to be consistent with standard ANSI C (LVL)
- bios/kprint.h: silly debug macro HERE kprintf()s the location in file (LVL)

- bios/conout.S: fixed bconout5(c) bug when c >= 128 (LVL)
- removed obsolete bios/keyboard.h include/btools.h (LVL)
- in bios/vectors.S, init_user_vec no longer relies on the previous value of
  register a1 from init_exc_vec (LVL)
- bios/blkdev.c - the floppy_init does not use the hdv_init vector. A: works
  under STonX again. (PES)
- bios/bios.c - increased the fixed size sector cache to 4kB sector. That's
  enough for partitions smaller than 512MB. Ideally it should be 32kB (PES).

2002-01-20
- in bios/lineainit.c there is now the sysfonts array for linea.
  font_ring is not longer used by linea (MAD).
- keyboard reset (Alt+Ctrl+Del(+RShift)) implemented (PES)
- trying to get 16-bit sector number working in BDOS - one workaround
  in fsbuf.c makes DIR (fsfirst/fsnext) working correctly (it seems).
  The NEGATIVE_RECN value (currently -200) should be fixed when it will be
  clear what is FAT/DIR negative recn and what is unsigned recn in signed int.
  FAT traversing seems to be broken (Pexec fails for some files) (PES)
- blkdev.h: retrying in emulator is not necessary (PES)

  for reference, but ultimately it will go away. Fastram is allocated when
  requested but it is still not freed (the *term routines in proc need to
  be changed as well); Pexec() flag 6 supported. I did not test on Fastram but
  all of autoexec, EmuCON, loading progs from C: and A: work. (LVL)

- initinfo shows the available gemdos logical drives (PES)

2002-01-28
- 1-bit color depth on Falcon now in proper black-on-white colors (PES)
- machine_init() split to two phases - machine_detect() can be called very
  early() and new machine_init() creates cookies etc. (PES)
- screen.c now detects proper screen size from VIDEL registers - there's no
  more trash on the screen - the size is set to 640x480 (PES)
- lineainit.c sets the variables according to proper screen resolution (PES)
- fixed BDOS 16-bit FAT - integer computing was overflowing in fsdrive.c (PES)

2002-01-30
- bdos/osmem.c variables init fixed. (PES)
- bios/blkdev.c - mediach returns "not changed" status for hard drives (PES)

  enabled at the time when disk initialisation occurred) (LVL)
- added limited parallel port implementation (output only) (LVL)
- indented some files (LVL)
- bios/floppy.c: FastRAM floppy read/write (FRB usage was read-only);

  better this way with most applications (THH).

2002-07-30
- vdi/gsxasm*.c - Fixed bug in VDI that sometimes wrote to ROM area (THH).
- aes/crysbind.h - Size of the addr_in array was not big enough for
  fsel_exinput(). Now this AES call should work, too. (THH)

- bios/startup.S - Filled the remaining empty ROM header entries (THH).
- aes/gemasm.S - Accessories are now working on CPUs >= 68010, too! (THH).
- bios/fntlat2_*.c - Czech language okay (make COUNTRY=cz) but file now is
  too big for 256k: comment out another country in po/LINGUAS to try out
  cz country on a <256k emulator; UNIQUE cz does not work yet (LVL)
- bios/startup.S - deleted unused function vidchng() (MAD)

2002-09-11
- bios/startup.S - added NatFeat detection code (PES)
- bios/bios.c - added 'int native_features' flag (please move elsewhere as

  there) (PES)
- bios/disk.c - adapted to NatFeat. Finally clean XHDI interface that other
  emulators may follow. (PES)
- bios/machine.c - a very hackish code for reading NF_NAME in place
  of emulated machine name. Where to get a bit of free RAM? Please fix it.
  (PES)
- bios/initinfo.c - added 5 seconds delay so users can enjoy machine name.
  The waiting is not using CPU STOP insn yet. Also needs to be
  interruptable by a keypress. Would be nice if it was possible to jump
  to the EmuShell instead of booting the GEM by pressing a key. (PES)

2002-09-14
- desk/icons - removed unnecessary 48x24 icons, added sed scripts to help edit
  icons (LVL)
- desk/desk_rsc.c - menu items are automatically adjusted to the right size

  some redundancy as I can't figure yet how to avoid duplication between
  country.mk and country.c (LVL)

               - get_pix() for linea reimplemented in C (MAD)
               - rectfill() implemented in C (MAD)

2002-09-20
- vdi/monout.c - abline() bugs fixed. Thanks, Johan! (MAD)

2002-09-21
- vdi/tranfm.S - vr_trnfm() implemented in assembler (MAD)
- vdi/monout.c - rectfill() in C (MAD)
               - habline() uses same sub-routines as rectfill() (MAD)
- vdi/gsxasm1.S - concat() moved to gsxasm2.S, where it is used (MAD)

2002-09-22
- vdi/monout.c - replaced asm vr_trnfm() by Johan's impl. in C (MAD)
               - fixed bugs in horizontal line drawing modes (MAD)

2002-09-25
- vdi/monout.c - fixed bug in color setting (MAD)

2002-09-27
- vdi/monout.c - optimized horzline() and rectfill()  (MAD)

2002-09-29
- make etoscpr.img makes experimental compressed-RAM-inside-ROM (LVL)
- use make comprtest to test the compressor (LVL)
- bios/memory.s - debug messages optional (LVL)
- added -pedantic to $(NATIVECC) options, killed some warnings in tools (LVL)

2002-09-30
- tools/compr.c et al - added a header in the compressed data, for a cleaner
  handling of the destination address in ROM (LVL)
- Makefile - code factorisation, various optimisations, foo.dsm is
  desassembly for foo.img (LVL)
- util/comprtst.sh - changed . t into sh -f t for portability (LVL)
- doc/status.txt - changed the table of supported emulators, to include date
  of update of individual entries (LVL)
- doc/install.txt - documented some of the current makefile targets (LVL)

2002-10-05
- renamed _FOO_H into H_FOO_ for standard C compliance (I kept the script
  which did it in case anybody wants to change back or again) (LVL)
- bdos/time.[ch] - regrouped stuff here, and connected it to _evt_timer (LVL)
- bdos/rwa.S - removed some useless remnants, osinit now in C (LVL)
- vectors.S - unused vectors _int_timera, ... deleted; priv and illg now
  correctly jump to the default exception vector (LVL)
- tosvars.h, vdimain.c - etv_timer gets an int argument (LVL)
- bios.c - commented out illegal error setting, as I don't think it does the
  right thing [changing a move SR, to CCR, is done by the priv stuff] (LVL)

2002-10-12
- merged tools/keytbl2c and util/dumpkbd.c - now dumpkbd.prg directly
  generates keyb_xx.h (LVL)
- Makefile - fixed a bug in make depend (LVL)

2002-10-13
- renamed font files, to allow a systematic handling of fonts (LVL)
- bios/country.c - tables now generated from country.mk in bios/ctables.h (LVL)
- Makefile - introduced $(TOCLEAN) that gradually stores the name of files
  to be removed when doing make clean, to make it harder to forget files
  in make clean (LVL)
- doc/country.txt - updated, but still not entirely satisfactory (LVL)

2002-10-14
- Makefile - some more optimisations: removed tedious $(PBIOSCSRC) stuff;
  less sub-processes are launched (e.g. grep | sed | sort | sort replaced
  by the more logical sed | sort ... sometimes you just see when things
  were done (by me!) just using a trial and error method) (LVL)
- portab.h - removed commented-out and some seldom used macros. Ultimately
  I would like to replace NULL-used-to-mean-char-zero by '\0' and have
  NULL and NULLPTR be ((void*)0). Then we could replace NULLPTR by NULL and
  forget about NULLPTR... (LVL)

2002-10-18
- genctables.awk - portable awk, country names need not be 2 chars long (LVL)
- bios/processor.[hS] - 68040 instruction cache stuff (LVL)
- bdos/proc.c - instruction cache invalidation on pexec (LVL)
- bios/vectors.S - illegal instruction handler now changes move-from-CCR to
  move-from-SR (LVL)
- bios/bios.c - illegal instruction handler only called on a bare 68000 (LVL)
- Makefile - if a file local.mk is found, it will be included at the end just
  before targets clean and distclean, for optional individual targets (LVL)
- ikbd.[ch] - dead keys (see keyb_fr.h for an example of how to configure
  the keyboard to use it); ALT-keypad to enter chars by decimal numbers (LVL)
- added "%p" in printf format string to print pointers as 0x%08lx (LVL)
- changed again H_FOO_ to FOO_H (sorry about this, I won't change it
  a third time) (LVL)
- include/config.h - removed "i18nconf.h" from there, as it caused trouble
  with tools needing "string.h" but not "i18nconf.h" (LVL)

2002-10-19
- bios/bios.c - display initinfo before you start booting from a device
  so that users have time to press and hold the Alt key to skip the boot (PES)
- bios/blkdev.c - added check for the Alt key (PES)
- bios/initinfo.c - can't display the boot device - it's unknown ATM (PES)
- bios/bios.c - check for Ctrl key fixed (hold it to skip AUTO\*.PRG) (PES)
- bios/initinfo.c - delay can be interrupted by Shift/Ctrl/Alt keys (PES)
- bios/cookie.c - number of free slots corrected (PES)
- bios/machine.c - COOKIE_NATFEAT created (PES)
- bios/startup.S, bios/disk.c, bios/machine.c - NatFeat instruction codes
  changed to LineF $fe00/$fe01 (PES)

2002-10-20
- bios/startup.S, bios/disk.c, bios/machine.c - NatFeat instruction codes
  changed back to good old $7300/$7301. The LineF interface requires
  the $fe0x instructions to be long words and I am not ready to accept
  such change of NatFeat calling convention. Sorry. (PES)

2002-10-28
- bios/bios.c - loading of AUTO folder programs displayed on stderr console
  via new NF_STDERR (sorry for the mess in bios.c, the nf calling must be
  cleaned up somehow). (PES)

2002-10-31
- Makefile - changed, so that vdi/lisaesc.S is used again (MAD)
- aes/gemdosif.S - changed to lowercase and put _back after entry (MAD)

2002-11-02
- aes/geminit.c - held Ctrl key causes not loading the ACCs (PES)

2002-11-03
- bios/xhdi.[ch] - XHDI implemented - allows running FreeMiNT (PES)
- bios/disk.c - some functions moved to the xhdi.c (PES)
- bios/blkdev.c - initialization order changed (PES)
- bios/machine.c - add XHDI cookie to the jar (PES)
- bios/startup.S - XHDI entry point (PES)
- bios/initinfo.c - missing #include (PES)

2002-11-07
- util/intmath.c - central impl. of (s)mul_div()    (MAD)

2002-11-09
- aes/gemgsxif.c - changed i_lptr1 to use just one argument (MAD)

2002-11-16

- "__NF" cookie now contains pointer to the NatFeat structure with
  function pointers (PES)

2003-01-14
- bios/vectors.S - the screenpt must be cleared after successful video
  registers update (PES)
- NatFeat calling cleaned up - uses function pointers now (PES)

2003-01-20
- bdos/fsdir.c - Fsfirst/Fsnext nesting fixed. This was a very important
  fix since without this the AUTO folder processing didn't work (Standa)
- bdos/proc.c - local or global variable referenced? Fixed by a wild
  guess (Standa)
- bios/bios.c - restore our DTA when processing the AUTO folder since
  the executed AUTO program could have changed it in the meantime (PES)
- bios/blkdev.c - TOS uses a different algorithm for detecting whether
  a FAT partition is 12-bit or 16-bit. From mtools I understood that
  anything with non-floppy-standard cluster number (probably 720/1440)
  is considered to be 16-bit FAT. Without this patch 4 MB disk image
  formatted with TOS could not be used under EmuTOS. Now fixed (PES)

2003-01-21
- bdos/fsfirst.c - yesterday's patch corrected (Standa)
- bios/bios.c - the Setdta() should not be needed (Standa)

2003-01-29
- bdos/kpgmld.c - cleaned interface with proc.c a little bit (LVL)
- bdos/proc.c - yet another cleanup of the xexec() implementation; there
  should be no memory leak any more in case of IO error, but of course this
  feature is untested as of now (LVL)

2003-02-01
- bios/ikbd.[ch] - dead keys fixed, backspace seems to work okay now (LVL)

2003-02-06
- bios/bios.c - natfeat printing changed back to kprintf (PES)
- bios/screen.[ch] - a routine for programming VIDEL to produce any of
  bitplane modes on VGA monitor with 640x480 res. added. Also proper VIDEL
  reset is now done on init. The last missing thing is to fetch the
  pre-selected boot resolution from the NVRAM and apply it. Until then
  the default boot resolution will be the 2-color mode (PES)

2003-02-07
- bios/natfeats.c, natfeat.h, natfeat.S - general cleanup, library of NF
  functions added (PES)
- bios/kprint.c, kprintasm.S - ARAnyM code removed, NF support added (PES)
- bios/machine.[ch], bios.c - updated for new NF library (PES)
- Makefile, doc/install.txt, include/config.h - updated to support NF (PES)

2003-02-07
- doc/announce.txt - updated for release 0.6 (MAD)

2003-02-08
- bios/natfeats.c - display the short emu name so that initinfo fits in
  40 columns screen resolution (PES)
- aes/geminit.c - check the Control key only once, not before loading each
  accessory. The harddrives are so fast that it doesn't make sense to try
  and skip only some accessories ;-) (PES)
- bios/initinfo.c - corrected displaying of free RAM so it fits in 40 cols.
  Also added a TOS like boot timeout with a little boot guide and a gfx
  effect of countdown :-) (PES)
- include/config.h - #define TIMEOUT_ON_BOOT here or in your localconf.h.
  This was added especially to make Thothy happy - he doesn't like long
  boot timeouts... (PES)
- po/cs.po - Czech translation updated (PES)
- bios/initinfo.c - moved up the time bar a few lines (MAD)
- vdi/esclisa.S - used this instead of buggy vdiesc.c  (MAD)
- bdos/console.c - better code style (MAD)
- vdi/vdiesc.c - used this again  (MAD)
- po/de.po - updated (MAD)

2003-02-09
- doc/annouce.txt - minor english language rewording (LVL)
- po/fr.po - updated (LVL)
- include/version.h - set to 0.6 (LVL)
- include/config.h - added DETECT_NATIVE_FEATURES (I assume it was only in
  Petr's localconf.h) and set it to 1 by default. I checked that it works on
  on both non-nf-enabled-yet STonX and on newly-nf-enabled STonC. I suggest
  to get rid of the STonX native print stuff as soon as I commit to STonX the
  quick natfeat implementation I just added to STonC (LVL)
- natfeat_init() called in memory.S, for earlier availability of kprintf (LVL)
- bios/bios.c - DBGAUTOBOOT added so that the AUTO crash is visible (PES)
- bios/ikbd.c - corrected debug typo (PES)

2003-02-10
- bios/bios.c - now using the reentrant trap1_pexec() to load programs (THH)

2003-02-11

2003-02-12
- bios/ikbd.c - initial settings of conterm hopefully fixes the hotkeys
  in XaAES (PES)
- Fixed some bugs in EmuCON (for example the initial Mshrink was not working).
  Now it is also possible to quit it with "EXIT" again. (THH)
- EmuCON can now be compiled into EmuTOS together with the AES/Desktop and
  it can even be executed from the Desktop now! (THH)
- tools/bug.c - Added missing include file. (THH)
- util/intmath.c - fixed bug in mul_div, circles work again (MAD)
- po/de.po - updated (MAD)

2003-02-15
- desk/deskapp.c - Icon masks are working now (THH).
- po/fr.po - updated. I think we should put back the EmuCON strings in it,
  since we now have decided to put back the console in EmuTOS. The size will
  not be a problem for 512k images, and for other sizes UNIQUE is fine.
  However this will have to wait till I fix bug to bring back old entries
  into life. (LVL)
- bios/comprimg.S - added natfeat_init stub, converted debug print from STonX
  to NF_STDERR (LVL)
- Makefile - version string deduced from doc/changelog.txt (only partly
  done, the version in the desk info menu is still taken from version.h) (LVL)
- bios/bios.c, natfeat* - NF_SHUTDOWN tried before halting (LVL)

2003-02-18
- bios/screen.c - Falcon VIDEL better supported. Should allow boot in colors
  but there is still something wrong in the EmuTOS as it requires the rez_reg
  to be set (can't find out why) (PES)

2003-02-19
- bios/screen.c - cleaned up the getrez a bit (MAD)

2003-02-20
- bios/screen.[ch] - VIDEL color registers supported, EmuTOS can boot
  in 2, 4 or 16 colors now! (PES)
- bios/screen.[ch] - setphys() safeguard check (PES)
- bios/nvram.c - fixed wrong offset, added static buffer for nvram data (PES)
- bios/machine.c - early initialization of nvram (PES)
- bios/screen.c - make use of NVRAM boot resolution setting. Tested on
  ARAnyM (aranym -e -r <X>) and should work also on real Falcon030. (PES)
- doc/announce.txt - updated for 0.6 release (MAD)

2003-02-21
- bios/lineainit.c - quick patch to get 8x16 font in all resolutions with
  screen height >= 400 (PES)
- include/config.h - boot countdown time increased to 8 seconds (PES)
- po/cs.po - updated (PES)

2003-02-27

- Makefile - EmuCON is compiled in by default now (MAD)

2003-03-03
- aes/geminit.c, gemshlib.c : Experimental support for #Z line in EMUDESK.INF
  to start another desktop instead of the ROM desktop. (THH)

2003-03-08
- vdi/mounout.c - fixed bug in clipbox() (MAD)

2003-03-10

2003-04-12
- bios/screen.c - some debug prints (LVL)
- bios/vectors.S - the new palette pointer to load during VBL now erased when
  loaded (previously it was loaded at every VBL!) (LVL)
- include/config.h, bios/kprint.c - kprintf() prints to MIDI out port when
  MIDI_DEBUG_PRINT flag activated (to get debug prints e.g. on Steem) (LVL)
- fixed some .cvsignore files (LVL)

2003-04-13
- bios/sound.c - Fixed a wrong byte in the system bell data. (THH)
- include/xbiosbind.h - Added binding for Dosound(). (THH)
- aes/optimize.c - sound() now really makes sound with Dosound()! (THH)
- bios/biosmem.c - explanatory comment about memtop and membot added (LVL)

2003-04-17
- util/boot.c - removed 192k size limitation in RAMTOS loader (LVL)

2003-04-19
- bdos/proc.c - proc_go() now better documented (LVL)
- tools/mkheader.awk - simpler and smaller replacement of mkheader.c (LVL)
- doc/country.txt - updated following removal of mkheader.c (LVL)
- bios/country.h bios/ctrycodes.h - country codes now in separate file (LVL)
- Makefile - make cvsready now also expands awk files (LVL)
- bios/sound.c - minor comment editing (LVL)
- include/asm.h - removed ints_off()/ints_on() macros as I really think their
  direct use of the stack for storage is unsafe/unportable in conjunction
  with a C compiler (LVL)
- vdi/*.c - replaced ints_off(); ... ints_on(); by the traditional way:
  WORD old_sr; ... old_sr = set_sr(2700); ... set_sr(old_sr); (LVL)
- util/miscasm.S - gratuitious optimisation (LVL)
- bdos/comprimg.S - fixed syntax error in debug stuff (LVL)
- */*.c - replaced GNU extension '\e' by the proper ANSI '\033' (LVL)
- cli/coma.S - fixed bug preventing EmuCON usage from the desktop (LVL)
- bios/vectors.S - stack restored before jumping in dopanic() (LVL)
- bios/panicasm.S - made panic message a little bit more robust (LVL)
- bios/kprint.c - fixed dopanic() (LVL)

2003-04-21
- bios/initinfo.c bios/bios.c - hitting 'C' during initinfo launches an early
  EmuCON, as a first step towards what Petr really wants (?) (LVL)
- Makefile - bug no longer unnecessarily built when making UNIQUE=us (LVL)
- cli/command.c - implemented prototypes for gemdos bindings (LVL)
- bdos/fs.h - fixed DTA.dt_fname: the correct size is 14 bytes, not 12 (LVL)

2003-04-22
- aes/gemshlib.c, aes/gemstart.S, aes/gemdos.c : Fixed problem with shel_write
  when parameter isover was 0. (shel_write on the Atari-GEM does not execute a
  program directly!). I also included a new dos_exec function that makes the
  handling of the rlr->p_uda->u_spsuper problem much more easier (the new
  dos_exec has basically been taken from the old Lisa-GEM). (THH)

2003-04-24
- aes/gemsuper.c, aes/crysbind.h, aes/gemwmlib.c : Added wind_new() function
  (called wm_new internally). TeraDesk seems now to be working fine. (THH)

- desk/desk_rsc.c - menu sizes adjusted so that they fit in the screen (LVL)

2003-05-11
- bdos/bdosmain.c : Changed the GEMDOS version to a more reasonable number
  since some programs might depend on this value. (THH)

2003-05-13
- bdos/proc.c : Registers are now initialized to 0 again in proc_go() since
  some programs need A0 = 0 to test if they are running as a normal program
  or as an accessory. (THH)

2003-05-21
- bios/lineainit.c vdi/vdimain.c : Moved initialization of shft_off to
  lineainit.c so that some line-a functions also work from AUTO folder. (THH)

2003-05-26
- aes/gemsuper.c, aes/gemevlib.c : Fixed a problem with the mouse buttons
  in certain programs (Thing, Pixart, etc.). (THH).

2003-05-29
- aes/gemrslib.c : Fixed the remaining bug with TeraDesk by using an extra
  buffer for a temporary string (Quitting QED caused a crash or error message
  when it was launched from TeraDesk) (THH).

2003-05-31
- aes/rectfunc.c : Function inside() did not work if one of the parameters
  x or y was negativ => Changed type from UWORD to WORD. (THH)

  date_time (needed by Diablo-Emulator for  LM-laserprinter (MAD)

2003-07-06
- aes/gemsclib.c : Return value of sc_read() is now compatible to Atari GEM
  again and sc_clear() now clears all scrap files in the clipboard. (THH)

2003-07-12
- po/es.po: added Spanish translation of EmuTOS, created by Gabriel Huertas
  <gabrielhuertas@terra.es> (PES)

2003-07-13
- bios/clock.c: NVRAM RTC year offset now detected from RTC_TOS_VER (PES)
- include/config.h: RTC_TOS_VER documented but not defined by default (PES)
- Makefile: new target 'aranym' added - it defines all required features.
  The 'falcon' target was removed (I don't believe current EmuTOS would
  work on real Falcon) (PES)
- doc/todo.txt: removed a couple of entries that I believe were done (PES)
- bios/disk.c: added debug kprintf's to partition detection code (PES)

2003-07-21

  This fixes the EmuDesk Shutdown crash I was experiencing (PES)
- vdi/blit.c: implemented vrt_cpyfm, vro_cpyfm and bit_blt in C  (MAD)

2003-07-25
- aes/gemstart.S: _dos_exec() still having problem. Had to increase
  the stack offset from 0x40 to 0x50 (PES)

2003-07-27

  entries in the file menu that are needed to use this desktop mode. (THH)

2003-07-29
- vdi/blit.c: reactivated assembler implementation of vrt_cpyfm,
              vro_cpyfm and bit_blt till C is bug free  (MAD)

2003-07-31
- doc/*: updated doc to clarify country-oriented misunderstandings (LVL)

2003-08-02
- po/fr.po: updated
- tools/bug.c Makefile: bug produces util/langs.c directly; bug no longer
  complains about unknown charsets. (LVL)

2003-08-11
- po/de.po: Added missing strings and adjusted some of the form_alert strings
  to the 40 characters per line limit. (THH)
- aes/gemrslib.c: rs_str() now uses gettext(), too. (THH)

  desktop sources - thanks!). (THH)

2003-09-06
- desk/desksupp.c desk/desk1.c aes/gemgrlib.c aes/gemsuper.c :
  graf_shrinkbox() and graf_growbox() have been enabled again. (THH)

2003-09-25
- aes/gemfmalt.c aes/gem_rsc.c : The buttons in the form-alert boxes have now
  been placed at the bottom instead of the right of the box. fm_alert() also
  uses right clipping now, so there should be no more crashes when using a
  form-alert box in ST-LOW resolution. (THH)

2003-10-06
- desk/desk_rsc.c desk/deskinf.c po/*.po : Increased the size of some strings

2004-02-02
- bios/cookie.c: cookie_add() was not checking jar size. Fixed. Also the jar
  size increased to 20 entries (since EmuTOS takes 11 entries for itself).

2004-11-24
- Makefile: Replaced "-oformat" by "--oformat" (THH)

2004-11-29
- doc/coding.txt vdi/*.S: replaced all MOVEM.W by MOVEM.L as the MOVEM.W
  (memory to register) destroys the upper 16 bits of the registers :-( There
  was perhaps no real bug, but at least now there's no risk that someone
  not aware of this creates a bug by re-using a routine with MOVEM.W (LVL)
- Makefile: (hack) target '256' now builds a UNIQUE EmuTOS (LVL)
- bios/mfp.c: ACIA interrupts no longer enabled by mfp_init() (LVL)
- bios/bios.c: clarified order of ACIA initialization (LVL)

- bios/tosvars.[Sh]: ACIA stuff updated in sync with aciavecs.S (LVL)
- bios/vectors.S, bios/*.c: glue functions protect_xxx() used to safely call
  external user-supplied routines (hooks, vectors, ...) even if those alter
  registers D2/A2. Done for: bell_hook, kcl_hook, hdv_rw, hdv_mediach,
  hdv_bpb, bcoxxx[]. In fact I was surprised to see that some vectors are
  never called (hdv_init, hdv_boot, etv_term, etv_critic). Is it a bug? (LVL)
- bios/ikbd.c, bios/sound.[ch]: keyclick() reportedly gets scancode as
  argument in register d0 (LVL)
- bios/vt52.c: bell() called depending of bit 3 of conterm (LVL)

2004-12-03
- bios/processor.S: TTRs registers setup on a 68040 (probably quite useless
  on our current emulators, but who knows...) (LVL)
- aes/gemgraf.c: removed the -1 pixel correction in gsx_tblt(); the AES text
  displays correctly now (used to be displayed one pixel up, which was
  annoying on small resolutions) (LVL)
- aes/gemgraf.c: improved display of window elements by ensuring that
  gl_wbox is wide enough to hold the character glyphs (LVL)
- bios/vectors.S: fixed bug in VBL interrupt routine (_vblsem is WORD) (LVL)

2005-04-12
- vdi/vdi_fill.c vdi/vdi_misc.c vdi/vdi_fill.c desk/deskmain.c cli/command.c
  bios/vt52.h  bios/floppy.c aes/geminit.c: Applied patches from Markus

  in the function nvmaccess(). (THH)
- po/es.po: Added up-to-date translations from Gabriel Huertas. (THH)

  assembler file and a missing "extern" in the header file. (THH)

2005-04-14

  set the new physical screen address immediatly. (THH)

2005-04-21
- bios/fnt_l9_*.c: Added the Latin-9 fonts. (THH)
- po/LINGUAS po/es.po bios/country.h country.mk: Now using the Latin-9 fonts
  for the Spanish translation. (THH)

2005-04-25
- vdi/vdi_line.c: Changed draw_rect() a little bit (which is used for drawing
  filled polygons) so that the game "Ballerburg" now looks normal again. Well,
  I hope this change doesn't break anything else... (THH)

2005-04-26
- vdi_asm.S/vdi_mouse.c: Support for mouse wheel (vex_wheelv) via Eiffel
  style IKBD status packets. (JKL)

2005-04-27
- bios/fnt_l9_*.c: Fixed a problem with the Spanish fonts - added some missing
  characters. (THH)
- aes/geminit.c: The "#Z" line in EMUDESK.INF now also works if it is not the
  last line in that file. (THH)
- bios/screen.c: Added gap between screen ram and phys_top. (THH)

2005-04-28
- aes/gemwmlib.c: Default owner of the desktop window is now the current
  application, not the screen manager. This fixes the problem that some
  programs did not receive mouse button events. (THH)
- bios/linea.S vdi/vdi_mouse.c: Enabled the Line-A functions dis_cur & hide_cur
  again (they still seem to work fine and are needed for GFA Basic). (THH)

2005-04-29
- po/gr.po: Added George Nakos' update for the Greek translation. (THH)

2005-05-01
- aes/gemsuper.* aes/gemdosif.S: Slightly improved the super() function (the
  AES trap entry point function). (THH)
- aes/gemrslib.c: Menu dividers now look normal again. (THH)

2005-05-02
- bios/screen.c: Added screen resolution switching support to the Setscreen()
  XBIOS function (for ST screen modes only at the moment). (THH)

2005-05-09
- bios/linea.S: Line-A #9 must be v_show_c() and not dis_cur(). (THH)
- vdi/vdi_mouse.c: Mouse must not be displayed again if it is already visible.

2005-05-11
- aes/gemfmalt.c: Mouse pointer is now always turned on while displaying a

2005-05-12
- bios/tosvars.S aciavecs.S: Moved kbdvbase and iorec structures and buffers
  from tosvars.S to aciavecs.S since they are not officialially documented
  system variables. (THH)

2005-05-19
- bios/bios.c: Bconout() did not work correctly with characters >= 128. (THH)
- bios/startup.S: Changed the size of the initial stack from 16384 to 2048
  bytes - that is still more than enough, I hope. (THH)

2005-05-22
- aes/gemgsxif.c aes/geminput.*: Fixed the problem that the mouse was not
  moving in certain programs. (THH)

2005-05-23
- bios/screen.c: Setscreen() now also reinitializes the font settings when the
  resolution changes. (THH)
- bios/bios.c startup.S: Some code cleanup - renamed startup() to bios_init(),
  removed unused code, etc. (THH)

2005-05-30
- desk/desk_rsc.c: Increased the size of a string buffer so that Greek and
  Spanish translations don't cause a buffer overflow anymore.
- Updated the documentation for version 0.8

* Release: 0.8

2005-06-20
- cli/command.c: Fixed some typos (thanks to Eero Tamminen for the patch). (THH)

2005-07-05
- tools/tos-lang-change.c: Added Eero Tamminen's TOS language change program.
- country.mk bios/country.h bios/keyb_se.h: Added Swedish/Finnish keyboard
  table (THH).
- tools/mkheader.awk: Fixed OS_PAL to contain the right PAL/NTSC flag. (THH)
- desk/desk_rsc.c: Adjusted some dialog string positions so that the Finnish
  and French translation fit better into the dialogs. (THH)

2005-07-11
- aes/gemgrlib.c: Fixed stupid bug that prevented window dragging when EmuTOS
  was build with UNIQUE=xx option. (THH)

2005-07-12
- bios/startup.S: Changed size of initial stack back to > 8000 words. This is
  a work-around for some strange crashes with FreeMiNT and GFA-Basic. Someday,
  somebody with a lot of spare time should try to find the real cause for these
  crashes... (THH)

2005-07-22
- vdi/vdi_control.c: Implemented vs_color and vq_color (for ST/STe). (THH)

2005-07-24
- vdi/vdi_control.c vdi_col.c: Moved vs_color and vq_color to a new file and
  improved vq_color a little bit. (THH)

2005-09-08
  Patches by Roger Crettol:
- bdos/proc.c bdos/rwa.S: Correctly pass register D0 to _gouser in processing
  gemdos xterm (0x4C) call - was broken
- bios/keyb_sg.h bios/country.h country.mk: Support for swiss german keyboard
- cli/command.c: Revised ECHO, suppressing extra newlines in batch mode

2005-09-18
- desk/desk_rsc.c: Removed some more unused strings. (THH)
- doc/authors.txt doc/announce.txt: Updates for version 0.8.1 (THH)

* Release: 0.8.1

2005-09-19
- vdi/vdi_asm.S: reversed mouse wheel direction, now Milan compatible (PES)

2005-10-04
- po/fi.po: Eero Tamminen has updated the Finnish translation. (THH)

2006-02-20
- bdos/kpgmld.c: kpgm_relocate() added (SOP)
- bdos/proc.h: PE_RELOCATE Pexec mode 50 defined (SOP)
- bdos/proc.c: PE_RELOCATE mode added - it gets raw TOS executable data
  (the complete mint.prg) and relocates it as if it was loaded normally. (SOP)
- bdos/{umem.c, iumem.c}: some conditional debugging added (SOP)
- bios/bios.c: bootstrap() added - loads and starts MiNT kernel from emulator
  via BOOTSTRAP NatFeat.
  Also added a safety call to Setdta() after loading an AUTO program. Fixes
  problem with loading programs after BETADOS.PRG (it probably scratched
  the DTA buffer upon starting thus the consequent Fsnext() didn't work) (SOP)
- bios/natfeat.[ch]: nf_bootstrap(), nf_getbootdrive() added (SOP)
- Makefile: dd in cygwin needs binary flags (SOP)
- po/fr.po: Patrice Mandin translated cli/command.c to French and says that
  NLS is broken since untranslated CLI crashes (instead of falling back
  to English as Laurent designed it) (PES)

2006-05-03
- bios/kprint.c: fix bus error register printout for MC68040 (PES)

2006-05-05
- bios/vectors.S: _int_hbl handler had incorrectly commented the internal
  logic. And then Andreas noticed the misplaced jump label that could cause
  system crash if IPL was 1 or 2. (PES)

2006-05-22
- bios/natfeat*: nf_getbootstrap_arg() added (SOP)
- bios/bios.c: bootstrap arguments added (SOP)

2006-11-03
- bios/bios.c: natfeat_init() called as the very first thing in bios_init()
  so that first kprintf() can make use of the NF output, if available (PES)
- bios/startup.S: do not set supervisor stack before meminit as you don't
  know yet if there is any RAM at all. Also RAM might be cleared in meminit()
  eventually so you can't rely on the stack, anyway. Also kprintf_init()
  is now called here (before it was hidden in meminit()). (PES)
- bios/memory.S: main new feature is that all RAM is now cleared upon cold
  boot (if memvalid flags are not set correctly). This should ensure that
  EmuTOS does not crash during boot when it copies color registers from
  (previously uninitialized) memory to HW regs in VBL routine.
  kprintf() is no longer used here since it's too early (stack is not set
  yet because it would be overwritten, also all variables would be cleared).
  New #define ST_MMU and FALCON_MMU introduced. We should IMHO separate
  these routines and not include them in one EmuTOS binary. I doubt anyone
  would want to run ST EmuTOS on Falcon or vice-versa. (PES)

2006-11-18
- bios/memory.S: don't clear non-existing FastRAM (PES, thanks to Milan)

2007-01-18
- bios/screen.c bios/xbios: Implemented XBIOS functions EsetShift() and
  EgetShift() for setting and getting TT shifter mode. (THH)

2007-02-13
- bios/mmory.S: Check wether machine can really handle 32 address bits before
  setting up the FastRAM. EmuTOS now works in Falcon mode on Hatari again (THH)

2007-02-14
- bios/acsi.c: Fixed ACSI driver to also work with Hatari (THH)

2007-02-16
- bios/screen.c: Added sanity check - EmuTOS only supports up to 16 colors, so
  do not set 256 or 16-bit color mode during boot! (THH)
- bios/nvram.c: NVRAM checksum calculation was wrong - fixed now. (THH)

2007-02-22
- bios/screen.c bios/xbios.c: Experimental implementation of vsetmode (for VGA
  only at the moment). (THH)

2007-04-05
- desk/desk_rsc.c po/*.po: Updated the year in the copyright statement. (THH)

* Release: 0.8.2

2007-07-17
- bios/blkdev.[ch]: PUN_INFO structure added to satisfy FreeMiNT that wants
  to know the max sector size for setting up disk buffer. (PES)
- tosvars.[Sh]: export pun_ptr for setting up the PUN_INFO struct. (PES)

2007-07-24
- util/nlsasm.S: beware, movea.l does NOT set flags! Caused crashes.. (PES)
- util/nlsasm.S: empty string was not translated correctly and that was
  causing scary crashes. Fixed by explicit check for empty string.
  Intentionally not cached in the RAM cache since the empty strings are
  often replaced with something else at runtime. The cache can be rather
  dangerous in this respect... (PES)

2007-11-06
- vdi/vdi_control.c: Fixed v_clrwk() - the function now calculates the screen
  size in a proper way. (THH)
- vdi/vdi_defs.h cli/command.c: Fixes for compiling EmuTOS with GCC 4.2. (THH)
- include/nls.h util/nlsasm.S: Small size optimization - Do not use gettext()
  at all anymore when CONF_NO_NLS is set during "make UNIQUE=xx" (THH)
- util/nlsasm.S aes/optimopt.S: Hack for compiling EmuTOS with GCC 4.2.
  This compiler sometimes expects return values for pointers to be passed back
  in A0 instead of D0. So gettext() and scasb() have now been changed to
  satisfy this requirement. (THH)

2007-11-08
- util/memmove.S include/string.h: Removed the deprecated and unused function
  bcopy. (THH)
- util/stringasm.S: Patched strchr() for GCC 4.2. (THH)
- vdi/vdi_control.c: Now using memset() in v_clrwk() to clear the screen - this
  is hopefully a little bit faster than the former dumb loop. (THH)

2007-11-15
- aes/geminit.c aes/gemshlib.* aes/gemstart.S desk/desk_rsc.c desk/deskmain.c:
  Added the possibility to change the resolution between ST-low and ST-medium
  resolution (highly experimental!). (THH)

2007-11-19
- vdi/vdi_col.c: Palette is now initialized during v_opnwk() and added color
  mapping for 4 color mode (ST medium resolution). (THH)
- util/nlsasm.S util/stringasm.S: Removed A0-return-value hacks since there
  is a version of of GCC 4.2 (ported by Olivier Landemarre) which does not
  suffer from this annoying A0 "bug". (THH)
- desk/desk_rsc.c: Disable menu entry for changing resolution again - it is
  still way too incomplete for the public. (THH)

2008-01-05
- bios/screen.c: Since we only support VGA resolutions by now, toggle the
  double-scan bit in vsetmode when a RGB mode is requested. (THH)
- include/asm.h util/miscasm.S: Changed macros for swapping the endianess of
  a variable to use inline assembler - that's faster and less code. (THH)

2008-01-06
- include/config.h: STOP instruction will now be used by default when a
  TOS version >= 2.00 is compiled. (THH)
- bios/clock.c: Got rid of RTC_TOS_VER - the year offset in the NVRAM is now
  autodetected. (THH)
- vdi/vdi_mouse.c: Fixed off-by-one bug in VDI mouse driver. (THH)

2008-01-21
- include/biosbind.h bdos/fs.h: Added support for the extended Rwabs call,
  with lrecno parameter. (THH)

2008-02-07
- bdos/time.c bios/clock.c: Cleaned up and fixed BIOS and GEMDOS time and
  date functions, IKBD clock basically works now, too. (THH)

* Release: 0.8.3

2008-03-26
- bios/clock.c: EmuTOS did not work on STonX anymore due to a bug in the RTC
  detection. (THH)

2008-06-11
- bdos/fsmain.c: Dsetdrv returned an error code in case the specified drive
  number was invalid. However, it must return the drive mask of the available
  drives instead. (THH)
- bdos/floppy.c bdos/acsi.c: According to the Profibuch and Scheibenkleister,
  the DMA address registers must be written in a certain order. (THH)

2008-06-13
- bios/chardev.c bios/kprint.c bios/mfp.c: Added experimental support for the
  MFP UART input and output. (THH)
- bios/floppy.c bios/acsi.c: The timeout_gpip() function was declared twice,
  in acsi.c and floppy.c. Merged them now into one function only. Thanks to
  Jens Caroll for the hint! (THH)

2008-09-17
- bios/machine.c: Fixed cookies setup: _SWI cookie was never initilized, and
  in the _SND cookie the DMA sound bit was never set. (THH)

2008-09-29
- cli/command.c: Check for valid drive when running the SHOW command. (THH)

2008-10-03
- cli/command.c:
   -> Declared local functions and variables as static. (patch by E. Tamminen)
   -> Reworked the help texts. (patch by E. Tamminen)
   -> Removed command aliases ERA and INIT. (THH)

2008-10-29

  for the hint) (THH)

2008-11-03

- bios/bios.c: check for cold/warm start, show initinfo on coldstart only (PES)

2008-12-13
- bios/initinfo.c: global variable early_cli must not be initialized or it
  gets to DATA area in ROM space where you can't change its value later (PES)

2009-06-11
- bdos/bdosmain.c: GEMDOS function dispatcher now handles the amount of
  parameters on the stack correctly. No more accesses beyond the TPA. (THH)
