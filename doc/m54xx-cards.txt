EmuTOS - Support for flash cards on ColdFire V4e Evaluation Boards


To use the CompactFlash card, you need to have programmed the CPLD
(programmable component) on your board. You need to contact Logic PD
(the board manufacturer) to get the appropriate software package.

To use a micro SD card, obtain an adapter common in the Arduino
ecosystem. Search your favorite online shopping site for a phrase like
"Micro SD Storage Expansion Board Mini Micro SD TF Card Memory Shield
Module." This adapter should run at 3.3 volts and not have any 5 volt
level shifting support. The adapter should have these six pin
connections: 3V3, CS, MOSI, CLK, MISO and GND, not necessarily in that
order.

The upper right of the M54x5 evaluation board has a 14-pin "Mini ITX
Case" header with this pin out:

| Pin Name | Pin Num | Pin Num | Pin Name       |
|----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| DGND     | 1       | 2       | /PWRBTN        |
| DGND     | 3       | 4       | /BUTTON_MRESET |
| 5V       | 5       | 6       | DSPI_CS0       |
| 3V3      | 7       | 8       | DSPI_CS2       |
| 3V3      | 9       | 10      | DSPI_DOUT      |
| TIN3     | 11      | 12      | DSPI_DIN       |
| DGND     | 13      | 14      | DSPICLK        |

Use jumper wires to make the following connections to the SD card
adapter:

| Case Header Pin Name | Case Header Pin Num   | Micro SD Card Pin Name |
|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 3V3                  | 7 (not pin 9!)        | 3V3                    |
| DSPI_CS2             | 8 (not CS0 on pin 6!) | CS                     |
| DSPI_DOUT            | 10                    | MOSI                   |
| DSPICLK              | 14                    | CLK                    |
| DSPI_DIN             | 12                    | MISO                   |
| GND                  | 1 or 3 or 13          | GND                    |

The Coldfire builds have CF and SD card support enabled by default, so no
compile time configuration is needed.
