TOS 1.4 fix status
==================

Atari's "Rainbow TOS Release Notes" is a list of fixes and improvements
in TOS 1.4 compared to TOS 1.0/1.2.  Alternatively, it can be read as a
(probably) incomplete list of bugs in TOS 1.0/1.2.  Since many parts of
EmuTOS are based on the original DRI code, which corresponded closely to
TOS 1.0, we can use the Atari document as a checklist of potential EmuTOS
bugs.

This document summarises the Atari document, and lists the current EmuTOS
status for each TOS 1.4 fix:
    BUG: aaaaaa             the bug exists in EmuTOS; aaaaaa is more info
    FIXED: commit xxxxxx    the bug is fixed in EmuTOS by commit xxxxxx
    MISSING FEATURE         the bug is associated with a feature missing
                            from EmuTOS
    TO BE CHECKED           it is not yet known if the bug exists
    COMMENT: aaaaa          any other status, e.g. where EmuTOS implements
                            things differently from Atari TOS
The list is broken down into 5 major areas: AES, BIOS/XBIOS, Desktop,
GEMDOS, and VDI.  Within each area, topics are listed alphabetically.
Within each topic are items; items are numbered uniquely in the document,
starting at 001.



*******************************************************************
*                           AES Changes                           *
*******************************************************************

appl_init()                                                           Status
-----------                                                           ------
001. "appl_init()" call returns a version number of 0x0140 in         FIXED: commit 3c9682
     global[0].


Autorun Application
-------------------
002. When running an autorun application, the AES changes to its      MISSING FEATURE
     directory.
003. When an autorun application is active, AES gives accessories     MISSING FEATURE
     the same number of dispatch calls to initialize as they
     would have if the Desktop were starting up.


Context Switches
----------------
004. No context switches are allowed during the AES Critical          TO BE CHECKED
     Error Handler, correcting a bug where some media errors
     would cause the File Selector to crash at the next critical
     error. (See "File Selector")


Default Path
------------
005. The Default Path when an application starts is not changed       TO BE CHECKED
     by shel_write(), nor is it set when the AES shell runs an
     application.  From the Desktop, the user selects the
     "current path" by determining which window is topped when an
     application is launched.  The right mouse button can be used
     to set a different default path.


evnt_multi() and evnt_timer()
-----------------------------
006. evnt_timer() (or evnt_multi() with a timer) no longer cause      FIXED: since at least 0.8.5
     Desk Accessories to sleep forever.


File Selector
-------------
007. An application can now send a "title" string to the File         FIXED: commit 2565ad
     Selector.  See documentation for "fsel_exinput()."
008. FS provides 16 drive label buttons for easier drive              FIXED: commit 7cdac5
     selection.
009. FS now handles <RETURN> differently on text editing: after       FIXED: commit 462ed2
     editing a pathname, pressing <RETURN> enters the path and
     redisplays the FS.  After editing a filename, the FS exits.
010. If the user passes in a path with a leading backslash, this      FIXED: since at least 0.8.5
     path is appended to the default directory of the default
     drive internally, and files from the resulting directory are
     displayed.
     (The following clarification is added by Roger Burrows)
     This description is wrong.  Under TOS 1.04, if the path has
     a leading backslash, it is appended internally to the default
     drive; if it does NOT have a leading backslash, it is appended
     internally to the default directory of the default drive.
011. The static file allocation of 100 files per FS has been          FIXED: commit 4b53c9
     removed.  The AES will Malloc() memory for directories with
     large numbers of files.  If available memory is insufficient,
     fsel_input() will exit with an error code.
012. FS now handles long pathnames.                                   FIXED: commit bff77b
013. FS now handles multiple "abort/continue" errors correctly.       COMMENT: works correctly since
                                                                      commit 3a97a6 (implement critical
                                                                      error handler); bug was impossible
                                                                      before that.
014. FS preserves current DTA buffer addresses.                       FIXED: commit b4246a
015. FS preserves clip rectangles.                                    COMMENT: the AES always uses its
                                                                      own workstation when drawing, so
                                                                      user clip rectangles are unchanged
016. FS preserves default directories.                                FIXED: commit f29cf5
017. If a diskette is removed when the file selector is called,       FIXED: commit b5794e
     the system now handles "Cancel" on the resulting error dialog
     correctly.
     (The following clarification is added by Roger Burrows)
     Under TOS 1.04, attempting to access an empty drive results
     in "Drive X: is not responding".  Selecting "Cancel" causes
     the original path to be redisplayed.
018. FS now handles colons in filenames, even though the colon        FIXED: commit d843b7
     is NOT a legal filename character.
019. FS no longer displays files that have the Hidden flag set.       FIXED: commit f29cf5
020. Sequence of the file selector redraw has been improved to        COMMENT: EmuTOS redraw seems OK
     be more visually appealing.
021. Clicking anywhere in the file display window reloads a           FIXED: since at least 0.8.5
     directory without affecting the filename template in the
     PATH line.
     (The following clarification is added by Roger Burrows)
     There is a bug in this area of which the above is probably a
     poor description.  In TOS 1.00, if you modify the file path
     and click on the bar at the top of the file display window,
     you get a redisplay with the new file path, and then you get
     a second redisplay with the original file path.  TOS 1.04
     does not do the second redisplay.
022. Media errors no longer cause the FS to crash at the next         TO BE CHECKED
     critical error. (See "Context Switches")


form dial()
-----------
023. form_dial() now only forces the top window to be redrawn if      TO BE CHECKED
     it falls inside the rectangle of the form_dial().


Menu Bar
--------
024. Toggling between True and False on the Menu Bar no longer        TO BE CHECKED
     corrupts the semaphore.
025. The Menu Bar line is now redrawn in REPLACE mode, rather         COMMENT: EmuTOS draws the Menu Bar
     than XOR mode; this prevents the AES from "undrawing" a menu     line in TRANSPARENT mode, which is
     bar line already drawn by an application.                        the same as REPLACE for solid lines


Menus
-----
026. AES now reserves 1/4 of the current screen memory (rather        FIXED: commit 2d2368
     than 1/4 of 32000 bytes) as a menu dropdown buffer, allowing
     applications to take advantage of large monitors with larger
     menus than possible on smaller screens.


Mouse Clicks
------------
027. Mouse single click response has been improved for                TO BE CHECKED
     applications which don't request double clicks.  Now,
     applications which use only single click event reporting
     will feel more responsive.


Mouse Cursor
------------
028. AES no longer accidentally restores a previously saved mouse     TO BE CHECKED
     state in favor of the state set with graf_mouse().  This
     behavior sometimes caused the cursor to remain a busy bee
     even after an application had set it to an arrow, or to
     leave "trails" in the menu bar.


form_center()
-------------
029. form_center() was changed so a form's X coordinate is no         FIXED: commit be1d27
     longer character aligned; odd-sized forms will no longer
     appear off center when form_center() is used to get centered
     coordinates.


rsrc_load()
-----------
030. rsrc_load() no longer uses the shel_read()/write() buffer as     FIXED: commit f943c0
     temporary storage, so the full pathname of a Desktop-launched
     application is always available in the shel_read()/write()
     buffer.


shel_envrn()
------------
031. shel_envrn() now uses the actual environment string to           COMMENT: there were several bugs,
     search for environment variables, rather than using its          discovered over a period of years,
     own fixed copy; environments, including the PATH= string         that affected PATH= handling; they
     AES uses to find resource files, can be set up in the AUTO       were finally fixed by commit e160a4
     folder and used by all applications thereafter.
032. Path name separators can now be commas or semicolons;            FIXED: commit 60b845
     previously, semicolons were required.


shel_find()
-----------
033. shel_find() now looks first in the directory indicated in        FIXED: commit f166f3
     the shel_read()/write() buffer (the directory from which an
     application was launched), then in the current directory, then
     down the environment search path.  Installed applications can
     be anywhere, and still find their resources.


wind_get()
----------
034. A wind_get() call with field parameter of WF_SCREEN is now       FIXED: commit f29cf5
     supported.


Windows
-------
035. When the user clicks in the scroll area of a window, AES         TO BE CHECKED
     waits for a double click time before starting the scroll
     repeat.  Single clicks only cause one message to be sent.



*******************************************************************
*                       BIOS/XBIOS Changes                        *
*******************************************************************

Boot Sequence                                                         Status
-------------                                                         ------
036. The ROMs check the DMA port for bootable devices.  Each          TO BE CHECKED
     device now gets a second chance if the first try at a boot
     sector returns an error.


Disk Boot
---------
037. Floppies are checked for "bootability" on warm and cold          TO BE CHECKED
     starts, even if an autobooting hard disk is attached.
     Before, this was done only on a cold boot.


Disk Formatting
---------------
038. Disks are formatted to be compatible with the IBM PC;            FIXED: commit 9083c6
     Protobt() creates MS-DOS format floppy boot sectors.
     Programs should place E9 00 4E in the first 3 bytes to
     insure MS-DOS compatibility.  Programs which do not use
     these calls to format the disk will not be affected.


Floppy Seek Rate
----------------
039. A new call, Floprate(), has been provided to check or set        FIXED: commit ef8e32
     the seek rate for a floppy drive.  See BIOS/XBIOS
     Supplemental Documentation.


Keyboard Repeat
---------------
040. Keyboard repeating has been improved: if you hit a key           FIXED: commit 24bb6a
     (say, '#'), and hold it down, you will get lots of #'s.
     If you then hit '$' without lifting your finger off '#' you
     will get one $ then many $'s.  The $'s won't stop repeating
     until you let go of the '$' key, even if you do let go of
     the '#' key in the meantime.


Keyboard Reset
--------------
041. Reset is available from the keyboard.  Hold down the             FIXED: commit 03499b
     <Control> and <Alternate> keys, and press "Delete" (below
     "Backspace").  This accomplishes the same thing as hitting
     the reset button.
042. <Control><Alternate><Right Shift><Delete> causes a VERY cold     COMMENT: cold boot doesn't clear all RAM
     boot.  It clears ALL of RAM (except about 64 bytes at the
     bottom) and then jumps to the ROMs.  This is to get rid of
     reset-resident RAMdisks, reset-bailout vector stuff,
     packages, and miscellaneous system variables that are
     cleared on a cold boot but not touched by a warm one
     (notably _bootdev).


Rsconf()
--------
043. Rsconf(-2,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1) now returns the last baud rate         FIXED: commit 6ad00c
     value set by Rsconf().  If the first argument to Rsconf is
     -2, the rest are ignored.
044. Rsconf() was documented as returning 'void' but actually         FIXED: commit 6ad00c
     returns the old values of the ucr, rsr, tsr, and scr
     registers.  It always has, but wasn't documented as such
     until now.


BIOS/XBIOS Supplemental Documentation
=====================================
Bconout()
---------
045. Bconout() to the printer returns 0 for failure, and a            FIXED: commit 315dae
     nonzero value for success.  This is used for the "Your output
     device is not responding" message in the Desktop, and is not
     handled through the critical error handler.  This has been
     true of all ROMs.
046. GEMDOS previous to Rainbow TOS just happened to return the       FIXED: commit 1af26d
     leftover value from D0, so using the GEMDOS Cprnout()
     function returned this, too.  New GEMDOS explicitly returns
     the status from the BIOS call from Cprnout().


BIOS Output-Status
------------------
047. The BIOS output-status functions for MIDI and Ikbd (devices      FIXED: commit 8f2ee8
     3 and 4, respectively) are reversed: Bcostat(3) gives Ikbd
     output status, and Bcostat(4) gives MIDI output status.  We
     can't change these back because programs may already be
     correcting for this behavior.


Floprate()
----------
048. Floprate(), XBIOS function 41, checks or sets the seek rate      COMMENT: EmuTOS validates input
     for a floppy drive.  This is new; the seek rate must be set
     with (previously) undocumented variables on earlier versions
     of TOS.  In either case, valid seek rate byte values are:
     Value   Rate
       0      6 ms
       1     12 ms
       2      2 ms
       3      3 ms
     This call does not range-check the drive ID or new seek rate
     value.  If devno is zero, it assumes drive A:, if nonzero,
     drive B:.


ikbd driver state variable
--------------------------
049. Kbdvbase() returns a pointer to a list of vectors for the        FIXED: commit 44fe81
     IKBD/MIDI subsystem.  At offset $24 from that pointer is a
     byte which is the ikbd driver state variable.  This has
     always been true; it's now being declared official, and
     will remain true.


OS Header
---------
050. As mentioned elsewhere in this document, the OS header           FIXED: commit 535746
     contains a pointer to the GEMDOS variable _run, which holds
     the basepage address of the process which is currently running.


*******************************************************************
*                         Desktop Changes                         *
*******************************************************************

Aborting Operations                                                   Status
-------------------                                                   ------
051. Copy, Delete, and Move operations can be interrupted with        FIXED: commit 5dabbf
     <Undo>; holding down <Undo> results in a dialog asking if
     the user wishes to abort.  (This does not apply to Disk Copy
     or Format.)


Application Crash
-----------------
052. When recovering from an application crash, wind_update(FALSE)    TO BE CHECKED
     is executed before going into the main event_multi() that
     waits for user interaction.  This is handled by the new
     wind_new() function.


Autorun Applications
--------------------
053. GEM programs can be autorun from disk.  This is set up           MISSING FEATURE
     through the "Install Application" dialog, where the user can
     select "Auto" (boot) status, then "Save Desktop".  The
     autoboot application can also be uninstalled from this
     dialog.  The autoboot application can be either a "PRG" or
     a "TOS", but not a "TTP".
054. Selecting a new Autorun Application will replace the             MISSING FEATURE
     previous one.


Copy, Delete, Move
------------------
055. The Copy, Delete, and Move dialog box shows destination          MISSING FEATURE
     folder and file name as the operation progresses.  The file
     name is displayed immediately in the box as the operation
     begins.


Desk Accessories
----------------
056. Desk Accessories can write any MN_SELECTED message to the        FIXED: since at least 0.8.5
     Desktop.


DESKTOP.INF
-----------
057. The DESKTOP.INF file remains compatible across all existing      COMMENT: true for EMUDESK.INF
     versions of TOS.
058. A warning message appears if there is insufficient space to      COMMENT: true for EMUDESK.INF
     save DESKTOP.INF.


Dialog Boxes
------------
059. Many dialogs are more concise.  This includes error dialogs      FIXED: commit f83c16
     like the one about "Your output device is not receiving
     data..." and others.
060. Leading underscores in numeric fields of boxes have been         FIXED: commit 06f9c9
     replaced by spaces.


Disk Copy
---------
061. Single-drive disk copies now require as few disk swaps as        MISSING FEATURE
     possible; all available memory is used as a copy buffer.
062. When copying disks between drives A: and B:, with no disk        COMMENT: for the disk copy feature,
     in source or destination, an error occurs.  "Cancel" now         EmuTOS works like TOS3 rather than
     returns the user to the Disk Copy Dialog.                        TOS 1.04: there is no special floppy
                                                                      disk dialog.

Disk Copy/Format
----------------
063. Disk Copy and Disk Format have been combined into one dialog     COMMENT: not applicable to EmuTOS
     box.  Whichever operation was chosen from the Desktop is the     (see comment for #062)
     default in the box when it appears.  For example, if disk A:
     is dragged to disk B:, the Copy/Format box appears with
     "Copy" selected.  By clicking the "Format" button, the user
     can choose to format a disk.
064. If users click Format from Copy, or vice versa, reasonable       COMMENT: not applicable to EmuTOS
     defaults appear for the newly selected operation.                (see comment for #062)


Disk Directories
----------------
065. If you try to get a directory of a drive without a disk,         FIXED: commit 3a97a6
     'Cancel' now aborts the operation and returns you to the
     Desktop.
066. Pressing <Esc> forces the Desktop to read the directory of       FIXED: commit 47720e
     the topped window.  Before it would only do so if a media
     change had been detected.
067. The Desktop now re-reads all open directories (instead of        TO BE CHECKED
     only those of drives A: and B:) after an operation which
     could change the directory information.


Disk Format
-----------
068. The "Format Disk" dialog now defaults to "Exit" if <Return>      MISSING FEATURE
     is pressed.  This is consistent with other parts of the
     Desktop.
069. The Desktop now formats disks with an MS-DOS compatible boot     MISSING FEATURE
     sector.
070. Double-sided disks are now "twisted" in a more-efficient way     MISSING FEATURE
     than before.  Single-sided disks are already "twisted"
     optimally, and have been since Mega ROMs.


Disk Open
---------
071. If an error occurs when a drive is 'opened', a blank window      FIXED: commit 163362
     no longer results.


File Copy
---------
072. When files are copied, the pointer now changes to a "busy        FIXED: commit f1217f
     bee" even if the Desktop is set to copy without confirmation.
073. When copying files and an error occurs, the arrow now            FIXED: commit 08e044
     becomes a busy bee when Retry is clicked.
074. Files dragged to the border of a window whose first folder       FIXED: commit e5a3a8
     is not displayed are copied to the current directory of that
     window.  Previously, the files would be copied into the folder.


Files
-----
075. Files which are both hidden and system or read-only will no      COMMENT: EmuTOS behaves the same
     longer show up on the Desktop (or in the File Selector).         as Atari TOS, i.e. the files that
                                                                      do not appear are hidden, system,
                                                                      or hidden+system.

File Move
---------
076. A file can be "moved" as well as copied.  To do this, select     FIXED: commit 0df5c2
     the file(s), hold down <Control>, and drag the files to the
     destination.  <Control> is checked when the mouse button is
     released, so users can change their mind between Copy and
     Move mid-drag (especially useful if a number of files have
     been painstakingly selected).  When the mouse button is
     released, a "Move File(s)" box appears.


Filenames
---------
077. The Desktop no longer allows users to enter illegal              FIXED: commit 1af26d
     characters (like *, ?, or :) in filenames.


Folders
-------
078. If the user attempts to copy a file into a folder containing     FIXED: commit e9aa89
     a folder with the same name as the file being copied, the
     Desktop displays an "Invalid Copy Operation" alert box.
     Formerly, it would show a "Disk Full" error.
079. "Show Info..." now allows a folder to be renamed, just as it     FIXED: commit e28d46
     does files.
080. The Desktop no longer allows users to enter illegal              FIXED: commit 1af26d
     characters (like *, ?, or :) in folder names.


Installed Applications
----------------------
081. "Install Application" has a "Remove" button, and "Install"       FIXED: commit b74fe4
     is now the default.  This dialog is also used to choose
     Normal or Autorun status. (See "Autorun Applications")
082. The default directory of an installed application is always      TO BE CHECKED
     set to the directory of the document that invoked it, even
     if the document is opened from a background window.
083. Only the "filename.ext" is passed to the installed               TO BE CHECKED
     application on its command line.  This fixed programs that
     only expected 14 characters of command line.


Install Disk Drive
------------------
084. "Install Disk Drive" has "Install" as its default.               FIXED: commit 924ab1


Name Conflicts
--------------
085. Upon a "Name Conflict" during a Copy or Move operation, the      COMMENT: EmuTOS uses OK/Skip/Stop
     user has three choices: Copy goes ahead and copies the file
     (overwriting the one on the destination), Skip does nothing
     with that particular file but continues the operation, and
     Quit aborts the entire operation.
086. "Set Preferences" determines if the system confirms name         FIXED: commit cc4955
     conflicts.  If "Confirmation required for: File Overwrites"
     is set to "No", files will be overwritten without warning.
     If a folder name conflict occurs, a dialog appears regardless.
087. Choosing "Skip" on a folder name conflict skips the entire       FIXED: commit eb8b03
     folder; choosing "Copy" begins copying files into the target
     folder that caused the name conflict.


Print Text File
---------------
088. The keyboard is checked every 16 characters; q, Q, ^C and        MISSING FEATURE
     <Undo> all cause printing to abort.


Running Applications
--------------------
089. Applications can be run from background windows; when the        FIXED: since at least 0.8.5
     Desktop launches an application, it shel_write()s the full
     pathname of the application.


Selecting Files
---------------
090. If the <Shift> key is held down while selecting files,           FIXED: commit f69658
     clicking anywhere within the window does not deselect any
     selected files.  Clicking outside the window or clicking
     anywhere with <Shift> released will deselect all the selected
     files.
091. By popular demand, selecting files in inactive windows by        FIXED: since at least 0.8.5
     holding down the right mouse button now works and is
     supported.
     (The following clarification is added by Roger Burrows)
     This is an imprecise description of the feature.  Files or
     folders in an inactive window can be selected by holding
     down the the right mouse button and *while the right mouse
     button is down* using the normal mouse click/cursor actions.


Show Info...
------------
092. "Show info..." for files or folders now uses the same            FIXED: commit 642b7d
     dialog.  The name field allows the file or folder to be
     renamed, but file attributes are only active for files.
093. The date separator in "Show File Info" and "Show Folder          FIXED: commit 642b7d
     Info" is now "/".   Before, they were inconsistent, one
     using "/" and the other "-".
094. "Bytes Available" and "Bytes Used" fields have been              FIXED: commit c53d3b
     expanded to accommodate values up to 2147483647
     (hex 7FFFFFFF).


Show Text File
--------------
095. Hitting <space> in the middle of a page makes the -More-         COMMENT: by design, EmuTOS
     come 24 lines from the line being displayed when the key is      only actions the quit keys
     hit, rather than having the same effect as waiting for the       (see #097) while the screen
     -More- and then hitting <space>.                                 is scrolling.
096. d, D and ^D cause the -More- to come 1/2 page from the line      FIXED: commit 2212d0
     being displayed when the key is hit; <Return> makes it come
     one line from the line being displayed when the key is hit.
097. q, Q, ^C, and <Undo> cause the output to stop immediately.       FIXED: commit dd3c87
098. Line Wrap is not modified; if the VT-52 Emulator is in           FIXED: commit 168713
     no-wrap mode, that's what you get.
099. If a "Drive Not Responding" alert box is displayed when the      FIXED: commit 98cb8d
     Desktop "Shows" a file, a message is printed to the screen:
     "Could not find filename.ext".  Pressing any key returns to
     the Desktop.
     (The following clarification is added by Roger Burrows)
     The actual message issued by TOS is "-File read error-"


Time/Date Stamp
---------------
100. The Time/Date Stamp on files is now preserved across Copies      FIXED: commit f1217f
     and Moves.


Windows
-------
101. The desktop now opens the next window where the last window      FIXED: since at least 0.8.5
     was closed.
102. The desktop shows as many files as possible inside each          FIXED: commit e7c1b3
     directory window.  The only limit is the amount of free
     memory in the system; this removes the old static file
     allocation limit of 400.
103. All background windows are updated after a file copy, move,      FIXED: sometime between
     delete, disk copy, or disk format operation.                     0.9.3 and 0.9.4

*                           GEMDOS changes                        *
*******************************************************************

GEMDOS Changes - Character I/O
==============================
Cconrs()                                                              Status
--------                                                              ------
104. Cconrs() now handles keystrokes where the high-order bit of      FIXED: commit ca1d10
     the ASCII code for the character is 1.
105. Cconrs() no longer echoes the input line to the console when     FIXED: commit 678684
     the standard input is redirected to come from a file.


Cconws()
--------
106. Cconws() is faster than before when handle 1 is redirected       BUG: compared to TOS 1.0,
     to a file.                                                       EmuTOS is about 18% faster,
                                                                      TOS 1.04 is about 1290% faster!


Character I/O
-------------
107. Character I/O functions (including Crawio() and Cconout())       TO BE CHECKED
     work predictably when redirected.  In particular, input and
     output status, and Cconout() work when redirected.


Control-S and Control-C Handling
--------------------------------
108. Console handling of ^S and ^C is consistent.  ^C during any      BUG: ^C does NOT interrupt
     "cooked" input or output function (Cconin(), Cconout(),          Cconin()
     Cnecin(), Cconws(), Cconrs(), and Fread() from a console
     device) causes the current process to terminate.


Standard Handles
----------------
109. Closing a standard handle (0-5) causes it to revert to its       FIXED: commit fdcaf7
     default BIOS device definition; previously this was
     undefined.  The normal way to deal with a standard handle
     is to Fdup() it to make a copy, Fforce() it to whatever you
     want, then Fforce() from the copy when you're done to revert
     back to what it was.  Closing now works, to at least get it
     back to a known state.


Type-ahead
----------
110. Console input type-ahead buffers are implemented correctly,      FIXED: since initial import
     and no longer grow without bound into the surrounding memory.    (verified by code inspection)



GEMDOS Changes - File Functions
===============================
Archive Bit
-----------
111. The "archive" attribute bit (0x20) is now correctly              FIXED: commit fdfa4b
     maintained: it is set when a file is created or modified.
     Archive/backup programs can check this bit to see if the
     file needs to be backed up, and can clear the bit when
     they have backed it up.


Duplicate Filenames
-------------------
112. GEMDOS now prevents duplicate filenames; it no longer            COMMENT: appears to be fixed
     occasionally creates two files with the same name.


Fattrib()
---------
113. Fattrib() checks the legality of what is being attempted;        FIXED: commit 03ba1f
     for example, an attempt to change the directory bit of a
     file or subdirectory will be denied.


Fdatime()
---------
114. Fdatime() no longer byte-swaps the user's input values when      FIXED: commit 18a3d6
     writing a new date/time.
115. Fdatime() returns EIHNDL for invalid handles and handles         FIXED: commit 9b38bd
     which refer to character devices (which have no date or
     time).


Fread() and Fwrite()
--------------------
116. Fread() and Fwrite() with a length argument of zero do not       FIXED: commit 1af26d
     hang.
117. Fwrite() calls which write to a character device (CON, AUX,      FIXED: commit 060ffe
     PRN) are no longer limited to 32K-1 characters.  Applications
     should still limit writes to retain compatibility with other
     versions of TOS, however.  Fread() calls which read from a
     character device have always been limited to 32K-1 characters,
     and still are.


Redirection
-----------
118. Redirection to the printer (handle 3, "PRN:") works              FIXED: since at least 0.8.5
     correctly.  Previously, GEMDOS would make the BIOS call for
     input status on the printer device, which is not supported.


Sector Buffering
----------------
119. Sector buffering in GEMDOS has been improved, and the user       TO BE CHECKED
     can add buffers to the FAT/root directory list to improve
     performance dramatically.  Old buffering was inefficient,
     and (in one case) actually wrong.


Tsetdate() and Tsettime()
-------------------------
120. Tsettime() and Tsetdate() cause the BIOS time and date to        FIXED: commit 4b3f47
     be set, too.  The reverse is also true: setting the BIOS
     date and time affects the GEMDOS values.  This is the same
     behavior as in the 4/22/87 (Mega) ROMs, where it is
     necessary for the real-time clock chip.



GEMDOS Changes - Directory Functions
====================================
Dcreate()
---------
121. Dcreate() (mkdir) now detects and handles errors; it             TO BE CHECKED
     recovers correctly from failures while creating a directory
     (such as write errors and disk-full errors), and does not
     partially build subdirectories.
122. Attempting to Dcreate() a directory with the name of an          FIXED: commit 1af26d
     existing file will return EACCDN.  Previously, it would
     delete the file, then create the directory.


Ddelete()
---------
123. Ddelete() immediately following a Dcreate() now works            FIXED: since at least 0.8.5
     correctly.  Formerly, this would fail but a second Ddelete()
     would work.


Folder Limits
-------------
124. The so-called "40-folder bug" is fixed.  There are still         FIXED: 
     limits, mainly on the depth of folders and the accumulated       initial fix by commit 410326
     depth of open files, but these limits are very far away and      main fix via commit 49d837
     can still be extended with "FOLDRXXX.PRG" which is widely        further help via commit f54411
     available.  Also, a folder only takes up space when it is
     "active", not just when you've seen it.  See "OS Pool
     Discussion."


Frename()
---------
125. Frename() can now rename a folder.                               FIXED: commit 7b03a8
126. Frename() cannot, however, move the folder around in the         COMMENT: EmuTOS can, however!
     directory structure, the way it can a file.
127. The entries for "." and ".." in subdirectories are correctly     FIXED: commit ac7552
     date-stamped.


Volume Labels
-------------
128. Fcreate(file, 0x08) will create a volume label IF the 'file'     FIXED: commit 778232
     ends up in the root directory of a device.  Otherwise you
     get EACCDN.
129. Before the new label is created, any label on that device        FIXED: commit aecc85
     is deleted. (Well, specifically, the first file in the root
     directory of the device with attributes == 0x08, if any, is
     deleted.)
130. You can create a volume label with the same name as an           FIXED: commit aecc85
     existing file, or vice versa.  Both will coexist just fine
     on the disk.
131. You cannot Fdelete() a volume label.                             FIXED: commit 1af26d
132. You cannot Frename() a volume label.                             FIXED: commit 8b517c
133. You cannot Fattrib() a volume label.                             FIXED: commit 1af26d
134. You cannot use Fattrib() to make a file into a volume label.     FIXED: commit 37deaa
135. You cannot remove a volume label. (But see above; you can        FIXED: commit 1af26d
     rename one simply by creating one with the new name.)



GEMDOS Changes - Processes and Memory
=====================================
Malloc()
--------
136. By and large, the restrictions on Malloc() (i.e. the 20          FIXED: commit f54411
     blocks/process limit) have been lifted.  Malloc() still uses
     the same internal "OS Pool" as folders, so it should still
     be used sparingly.  Use Malloc() for large chunks, and use
     another manager (such as a C compiler library's malloc()
     function) for general-purpose memory management.  Also,
     FOLDR100.PRG can be used to add to the OS Pool, which both
     subdirectories and Malloc() use. See "OS Pool Discussion."


OS Pool
-------
137. An exhausted OS Pool now results in predictable (and safe)       FIXED: commit d695ea
     behavior.  The machine will lock up with a message to the
     effect that the pool has been exhausted, and that you need to
     use FOLDRXXX.PRG to enlarge it. It no longer gives incorrect
     results; nor does it damage disks.
138. The OS Pool has been reduced to 11/20/85 size.  This may         COMMENT: Atari pool size
     allow some programs to run that ran on 520STs with 11/20/85      is 5600 bytes in TOS 1.04.
     ROMs but failed to run with Mega ROMs.                           EmuTOS uses ~8000 bytes.


Pexec()
-------
139. Pexec() handles exceptional cases correctly; it no longer        COMMENT: appears to be fixed
     causes bombs or leaves files open, and it releases memory
     correctly.
140. Pexec() deals correctly with files having more than 32K of       FIXED: since at least 0.8.5
     relocation information.
     (The following clarification is added as a result of
     investigations by Christian Zietz)
     The TOS 1.0 bug that this appears to describe occurs when
     there is more than 64K of relocation information; the net
     result is that the length of relocation information used
     is the actual amount modulo 64K.
141. Pexec() Mode 6, 'Just Go, Then Free', has been added.  Mode      FIXED: commit 2362ac
     6 is similar to Mode 4, except memory ownership is changed
     to the child process; when the child terminates, GEMDOS
     frees any memory allocated to the child, including its TPA.


Program Startup
---------------
142. The second of the two reserved longwords in a PRG file           FIXED: commit e7a337
     header is no longer reserved: it is now defined as a bitmap
     of requests for new features.  When the lowest-order bit,
     0x00000001, is set, it indicates that Pexec() should not
     bother to clear the program's entire heap, only the declared
     BSS.


Program Termination
-------------------
143. When a program is terminated with bombs (bus error, address      FIXED: commit 0d92d4
     error, etc.), its parent's Pexec() call returns with error
     code 0x0000ffff.  Previously, it returned with error code 0.



GEMDOS Changes - Other
======================
FAT Search Code
---------------
144. The FAT searching code for hard disks and floppies is much       FIXED: commits 79ab48, 497280
     faster.  This speedup is especially dramatic when using
     "Show info...", or when creating a file on a heavily loaded
     hard disk.


FATs (12 bit)
-------------
145. The 12-bit FAT code now deals with disks of up to 4096           FIXED: sometime between
     clusters correctly.  Formerly, only 2048 clusters worked;        0.8.5 and 0.8.6
     above that there were sign-extension problems.


Media Change
------------
146. GEMDOS now recognizes "media change" better.  It would           COMMENT: appears to be fixed
     sometimes fail before because GEMDOS was, in effect, using a
     cache without checking for media change.
147. Mediach() is more reliable when using logical drives A: and      MISSING FEATURE
     B: on a single-drive system.



GEMDOS Changes - Supplemental Information
=========================================
OS Pool Discussion
------------------
Technically, the limits are as follows: there are 80 blocks in
the system's "OS pool."  Two blocks are used per active folder.
An "active" folder is one which is the root directory of the
device it's on, or which has open files, or which is the current
directory of one or more processes for that drive, or which has
an "active" child (subdirectory).  Yes, this is a recursive
definition.  Remember that each process has a current directory
on every logical device, but also remember that one folder only
takes up two blocks, no matter how many reasons it's "active."

In addition, one block is used per open file, and 1/4 block is
used per memory chunk (allocated or free) in the system TPA.
In this context, an "open" file is one which has been Fopened
and not Fclosed; this is not the same as the "Open" operation
in an application.  When files are closed, processes terminate,
or memory chunks are freed (and coalesce into larger free
chunks), blocks are freed back into the OS pool.

The improvement over previous ROMs is this: the old definition
of "active" was "seen" - getting a list of the files in a
directory caused all the folders there to take up blocks in the
pool.  In addition, blocks never got freed in the pool.  Also,
once parts of the pool had been used for managing TPA memory
chunks, they were unavailable for managing folders, and vice
versa.  All these restrictions are lifted.

It is still possible to run out of pool, of course.  The
program FOLDR100.PRG was released by Atari and is part of the
HDX (hard-disk utilities) distribution.  It adds memory to the
OS pool, and it still works, adding memory to the new kind of
pool, too.  Placing this program in your AUTO folder causes 200
more blocks to be added to the OS pool, which is room for 100
more folders (remember, only ACTIVE folders take up room) or
800 more memory chunks, or any combination.  For more
information, see the FOLDR100.PRG documentation in your HDX
manual.

*******************************************************************

Mouse Code                                                            Status
----------                                                            ------
148. VDI Mouse Code now supports screens larger than 32K.  This       FIXED: commit a98c2a
     allows higher-resolution monitors (i.e. Moniterm).


vst_extent()
------------
149. vst_extent() now works correctly when the rotation is 270        FIXED: commit 023f6b
     degrees.  NOTE: there is no vst_extent()!  There is a
     vqt_extent() and a vst_rotation(); the bug with 270 degree
     rotation is a vst_extent() bug.


vq_mouse()
----------
150. vq_mouse() has been made more reliable through a code            COMMENT: no specific code rewrite in EmuTOS
     rewrite.
