A few notes on the EmuTOS startup sequence
==========================================

The EmuTOS startup sequence is similar to that of Atari TOS.  The
following keys affect startup:
   Alt: set floppy A: as boot device instead of first disk partition
   Esc: run an early console
   Ctrl: start up as a 'bare' system:
        do not use any Nova/ET4000 card present
        do not run AUTO folder programs
        do not load user-defined mouse cursors
        do not load desk accessories
        do not run an autorun program
        do not load desktop icons
        do not use the EMUDESK.INF file for desktop setup

Details
-------
Note: in the following, all files referenced must be in the root
directory of the boot device.

1. After some basic system initialisation, if a diagnostic cartridge
   is present, it is run.

2. ST RAM is initialised, then the BIOS and the rest of the hardware
   is initialised.  On ROMs other than 192K, the code checks for the
   presence of a Nova/ET4000 video board.  If detected, the video
   output is directed to it (this may be skipped by pressing the Ctrl
   key during startup).

3. If a cartridge is present, any type 3 cartridge applications are
   run (under Hatari, this is where GEMDOS emulation is set up).

4. On a cold boot only, the EmuTOS welcome screen is displayed.
   While the screen is displayed, the keys Alt, Ctrl, and Esc may be
   pressed to alter subsequent processing (see below).
   
6. If the user pressed the Alt key in step 4 above, the boot device
   is set to the first floppy (drive A:).  Otherwise it is set to
   the first partition of the first device found.  Devices are scanned
   in the following sequence: IDE, SCSI, ACSI, SD/MMC.

5. If the user pressed the Esc key in step 4 above, the Emucon2 console
   is displayed (on exit, the startup will continue as below).

6. All PRG programs in the AUTO folder are run, in directory sequence.
   This is skipped if the Ctrl key was pressed in step 4 above.

7. The AES is started.  If an EMUDESK.INF file is present, it is
   checked for a video setting (a #E line).  If a setting is specified,
   and it differs from the current setting, the current display mode
   is changed.

8. The AES is initialised.  If an EMUCURS.RSC file is present, user-
   defined mouse cursors are loaded from it.  This is skipped if the
   Ctrl key was pressed in step 4 above.

9. Desk accessories are loaded, if present.  This is skipped if the
   Ctrl key was pressed in step 4 above.

10. If an EMUDESK.INF file is present, it is checked for an autorun
   program setting (a #Z line).  If an autorun program exists, it is
   run.  This is skipped if the Ctrl key was pressed in step 4 above.

11. The desktop is started.  If an EMUICON.RSC file is present, user
   desktop icons are loaded from it.  This is skipped if the Ctrl key
   was pressed in step 4 above.

12. If an EMUDESK.INF file is present, it is used to set up the
   desktop display.  This is skipped if the Ctrl key was pressed in
   step 4 above, and a default display is set up instead.

At this point, desktop initialisation is complete, and EmuDesk waits
for user input.
