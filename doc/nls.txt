nls.txt - native language support for EmuTOS, 
or how having printf("welcome") display "willkommen".


Principle
=========

A gettext-like approach is used. A run-time function 

  char * gettext(char *)
  
is called on translatable strings, looks in a hash table and returns 
a translation. If no translation is found, the supplied string is 
returned. So we need to know
- what string is translatable
- when to do the translation

Translatable strings are marked in the source code using two ways: 

  _("blah")    is #defined as being      gettext("blah")
  N_("blah")   is #defined as simply     "blah"

Both macros are defined in "nls.h".
The former is intended to be used in expressions, the latter in 
declarations, as in the following example:

  #include "nls.h"
  char *answer_names[] = { N_("yes"), N_("no") };
  
  void print_answer(int answer)
  {
    printf( _("the answer\nis: %s\n"), 
           gettext( answer_names[answer] ));
  }

translatable strings not immediately translated by _(...) need
to be translated using gettext() explicitly.


Operations
==========

A tool called "bug" is supplied. Bug does three operations:
- xgettext: scan the C source files to collect translateable
  strings by looking for _("...") and N_("..."), and put all
  translatable strings in a po-file called messages.pot
- update po-file: compares the supplied po-file to messages.pot
  and updates the po-file (adding for instance new entries
  for new translatable strings)
- make: creates the C file(s) that will be linked to EmuTOS 
  to provide the translation hashes. NOTE: "bug make" is invoked
  by the EmuTOS Makefile, you should not invoke it directly.


po/POTFILES.in  }   bug xgettext
C source code   }------------------> po/messages.pot

                    cp
po/messages.pot }-------->  po/xx.po    (the first time only)

po/messages.pot }   bug update po/xx.po
po/xx.po        }------------------------->  po/xx.po  

po/LINGUAS      }   bug make   (invoked by the Makefile)
po files        }--------------> C source files
po/messages.pot }


Who does what
=============

The translator for language 'xx' owns po/xx.po. The translator
edits it, adding translations (initially all translations are
empty). It is the translator's responsibility to update the po-file 
regularly to make sure no translation is missing. "update" here 
means, generate po/messages.pot using bug xgettext, and then do 
bug update po/xx.po. This is a manual task. 

To build EmuTOS, a set of C source files containing the translation
hashes are needed. These files are output by bug make. Bug make needs
a po/messages.pot. Thus, the Makefile contains rules to run 
bug make and if po/messages.pot is not present, bug xgettext.

Running bug xgettext over an existing messages.pot is not done
by the Makefile, because the Makefile has no easy way to know
when this is needed. 


Makefile and CVS usage
======================

                  |   created  |  deleted by  |  committed
file              |   by make  |  make clean  |  into cvs 
------------------+------------+--------------+-------------
po/POTFILES.in    |      no    |      no      |    yes
po/LINGUAS        |      no    |      no      |    yes
po/messages.pot   | only when  |      yes     |    no
                  | absent     |              |
po/xx.po          |      no    |      no      |    yes
C lang hashes     |     yes    |      yes     |    no


Files
=====

po/POTFILES.in is a list of C source files, one file per line,
ignoring empty lines and lines beginning with #. 

po/LINGUAS gives the list of language names to consider, together
with the charset name to which they will be displayed in the
destination software.

po/messages.pot and the various po/xx.po are po-files, described below.


Format of po-files
==================

the po-file contains free comments (blocks of lines beginning with #),
and entries. Each entry has
- optional free comment lines, beginning with '# ' (sharp, space)
- optional special comments, beginning with #, and whose second
  character is not a space
- the English string,    msgid "..."
- the translation,       msgstr "..."  

the strings after msgid and msgstr follow the C syntax, and can contain
several "..." strings concatenated. Example:

  #
  # this is a commented po-file for the sample C source code above
  # this part is a free comment
  #
  
  # this is an entry
  # the line starting with #: is a special comment giving pointers 
  # to source code where the English string was found
  #: source/file.c:2
  msgid "yes"
  msgstr "Ja"
  
  #: source/file.c:2
  msgid "no"
  msgstr "Nein"
  
  # This entry shows multi-line entries
  #: source/file.c:7
  msgid ""
  "the answer\n"
  "is: %s\n"
  msgstr ""
  "Die Antwort\n"
  "ist: %s\n"


Administrative entry
====================

The first entry in a po-file is the administrative entry.
Its msgid is the empty string, and its msgstr contains
lines in the form "Keyword: value\n". This is an example
from the Czech GNU gettext po-file:

  msgid ""
  msgstr ""
  "Project-Id-Version: GNU gettext 0.10.38\n"
  "POT-Creation-Date: 2001-05-23 23:03+0200\n"
  "PO-Revision-Date: 2001-08-18 15:22+0200\n"
  "Last-Translator: Vladimir Michl <Vladimir.Michl@seznam.cz>\n"
  "Language-Team: Czech <cs@li.org>\n"
  "MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
  "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-2\n"
  "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"

The eight lines shown here are mandatory, in this order.
Bug uses the charset given in "Content-Type". 
The "POT-Creation-Date" field is set in po/messages.pot when 
doing 'bug xgettext', and copied from po/messages.pot into the 
po files when doing 'bug update'.
the "PO-Revision-Date" field is set in po files when doing 
'bug update'.


Details
=======

updating po-files will
- create a backup po/xx.po.bak
- keep all user comments from the previous po-file
- take no user comments from messages.pot (messages.pot is not
  intended to be edited)
- replace all #: references by those found in messages.pot
- comment out entries not found in messages.pot
- add entries found in messages.pot, but missing from the 
  previous po-file
- create an administrative entry if there is none
- update the date fields of the administrative entry.
The po-files are parsed entirely in memory, then written
back to files. Any special string formatting will be lost.


Hints
=====

GNU Emacs has a po mode that tend to annoy some people (including 
myself). To prevent GNU Emacs from opening your po-file in po mode,
put this text in your po-file's first line:

  # -*-C-*-

if your po-file in in ISO latin1 encoding, or a line like

  # -*- mode: C; coding: iso-latin-2; -*-

if your po-file is in another encoding (here, ISO latin 2).

When translating a *.po file, please note that some strings are limited
in size. For example, the texts used in a "form_alert" box are limited
to five lines with 40 characters each. Each of the three buttons of such
a "form_alert" box is limited to 20 characters.
You should always check the translated text in EmuTOS to see if it looks
as you expected it.
