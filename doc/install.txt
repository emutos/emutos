Installing:

You will need a (cross-)GCC toolchain for TOS/MiNT.
Currently, the only supported one is Vincent Rivière's m68k-atari-mint tools:
http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/
Other toolchains, such as the old one from SpareMiNT, may also work, too.
You will also need GNU make (tested with make 3.82.90).

Building EmuTOS
===============

To build, first do:

    make help

This will display the list of all possible targets.

To build the standard etos512k.img, do

    make 512

To build EmuTOS for a different country (changes the language and the
keyboard), do

    make 512 COUNTRY=en
or
    make 512 COUNTRY=fr
or
    make 512 COUNTRY=de

NOTE: by specifying COUNTRY=xx, all countries are included in the binary,
but a flag in the TOS header will indicate country 'xx'. If, however, the
EmuTOS image is booted on an emulator featuring NVRAM emulation (such as
ARAnyM), the country number in the NVRAM will override that setting of the
country in the TOS header.

To build EmuTOS for a single country only, you must use UNIQUE instead of
COUNTRY. This is mainly useful for the 192 and 256 kB targets. Example:

    make 256 UNIQUE=fr

Finally, some settings can be configured in the file include/config.h.

A complete list of targets
==========================

EmuTOS binaries
---------------

512     etos512k.img, EmuTOS ROM padded to size 512 kB (starting at 0x00e00000)
aranym  emutos-aranym.img, suitable for ARAnyM
firebee emutosfb.s19, to be flashed on the FireBee
firebee-ram ramtos.img + boot.prg, a RAM tos for the FireBee
amiga   emutos-amiga.rom, EmuTOS ROM for Amiga hardware
amigakd emutos-kickdisk.adf, EmuTOS as Amiga 1000 Kickstart disk

ram     ramtos.img + boot.prg, a RAM tos
flop    emutos.st, a bootable floppy with RAM tos
cart    etoscart.img, EmuTOS as a diagnostic cartridge

Binary targets modifiers
------------------------

nothing       same as COUNTRY=us
COUNTRY=xx    all countries in the binary, country xx being the default
UNIQUE=xx     a smaller binary with only support for country xx
DEF='-DSOMEDEFINE=value'
              used to override the default settings from include/config.h.
              WARNING: do "make clean" first.

Utility targets
---------------

fd0           dd emutos.st on a floppy (linux-specific)

Debug targets
-------------

dsm     dsm.txt, an edited disassembly of emutos.img
fdsm    fal_dsm.txt, like above, but for 0x00e00000 ROMs
*.dsm   disassembly of any .c or almost any .img file

CVS-related targets
-------------------

depend       generates dependencies
clean        cleans all generated files
distclean    as clean + deletes also some temporary editor files
cvsready     ensure the files have a proper, canonic, format for CVS
checkindent  try 'indent' without altering the files
indent       indent all files - never done yet :-(

Release-related targets
-------------------

all192  all 192 kB images
all256  all 256 kB images
allbin  all 192 kB, 256 kB and 512 kB images
release build the release archives into release-archives


STonX-specific notes
=======================

EmuTOS now needs no change in STonX any longer. It will run on a
normal STonX.

But, if you want to see debugging output in STonX, you need to do two
things:

1. implement a write_native function in gemdos.c of STonX:

    /* Print string from emulated side */
    void write_native(char * addr)
    {
        char buf[1024];
        int n;

        for(n = 0 ; n < 1023 ; n++) {  /* Fill string char by char */
            if ( (buf[n]=LM_UB(MEM(addr++))) == 0) break;
        }
        buf[1023] = 0;
        fprintf(stderr,"%s", buf);
    }

    void call_native(UL as, UL func)
    {
    #if 0
        fprintf(stderr,"Calling native %d\n",func);
    #endif
        switch (func)
        {
        case 0: /* Get the address, where string begins*/
            write_native((char *)LM_UL(MEM(as)));
            break;
        case 1:
    ...

(STonC release 0.8.0 and later already has this function)

2. Switch on the debugging output by setting, in include/config.h, the
   parameter STONX_NATIVE_PRINT to 1 before building EmuTOS.


Have success!
