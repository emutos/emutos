Installing:

You will need a (cross-)GCC toolchain for TOS/MiNT.
Currently, the only supported one is Vincent Rivi√®re's m68k-atari-mint tools:
http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/

Other toolchains may also work.  However, you will not be able to use one
based on GCC 2, for several reasons.  The most important of these is that
the generated binaries are just too large.

You will also need GNU make (tested with make 3.81 & 4.2.1).

Building EmuTOS
===============

To build, first do:

    make help

This will display the list of all possible targets.

To build the standard etos512k.img, do

    make 512

To build EmuTOS for a different default country (changes the language and the
keyboard), do

    make 512 COUNTRY=en
or
    make 512 COUNTRY=fr
or
    make 512 COUNTRY=de

NOTE: by specifying COUNTRY=xx, all countries are included in the binary,
but a flag in the TOS header will indicate country 'xx'. If, however, the
EmuTOS image is booted on an emulator featuring NVRAM emulation (such as
ARAnyM), the country number in the NVRAM will override that setting of the
country in the TOS header.

To build EmuTOS for a single country only, you must use UNIQUE instead of
COUNTRY. This is mainly useful for the 192 and 256 KB targets. Example:

    make 256 UNIQUE=fr

Many options are set via the configuration file include/config.h.  They can
be overridden most easily via #defines in a user-created file localconf.h.

It is required to do "make clean" before switching to a different target,
e.g., switching from 512k to 256k ROMs. The only change allowed without
"make clean" is to build (with same target) for a different language.
