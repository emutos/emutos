Installing:

You will need a (cross-)GCC toolchain for TOS/MiNT.
Currently, the only supported one is Vincent Rivi√®re's m68k-atari-mint tools:
http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/
Other toolchains, such as the old one from SpareMiNT, may also work, too.
You will also need GNU make (tested with make 4.2.1).

Building EmuTOS
===============

To build, first do:

    make help

This will display the list of all possible targets.

To build the standard etos512k.img, do

    make 512

To build EmuTOS for a different default country (changes the language and the
keyboard), do

    make 512 COUNTRY=en
or
    make 512 COUNTRY=fr
or
    make 512 COUNTRY=de

NOTE: by specifying COUNTRY=xx, all countries are included in the binary,
but a flag in the TOS header will indicate country 'xx'. If, however, the
EmuTOS image is booted on an emulator featuring NVRAM emulation (such as
ARAnyM), the country number in the NVRAM will override that setting of the
country in the TOS header.

To build EmuTOS for a single country only, you must use UNIQUE instead of
COUNTRY. This is mainly useful for the 192 and 256 KB targets. Example:

    make 256 UNIQUE=fr

Many options are set via the configuration file include/config.h.  They can
be overridden most easily via #defines in a user-created file localconf.h.

STonX-specific notes
=======================

EmuTOS now no longer needs changes to STonX. It will run on a normal STonX.

But, if you want to see debugging output in STonX, you need to do two
things:

1. implement a write_native function in gemdos.c of STonX:

    /* Print string from emulated side */
    void write_native(char * addr)
    {
        char buf[1024];
        int n;

        for(n = 0 ; n < 1023 ; n++) {  /* Fill string char by char */
            if ( (buf[n]=LM_UB(MEM(addr++))) == 0) break;
        }
        buf[1023] = 0;
        fprintf(stderr,"%s", buf);
    }

    void call_native(UL as, UL func)
    {
    #if 0
        fprintf(stderr,"Calling native %d\n",func);
    #endif
        switch (func)
        {
        case 0: /* Get the address, where string begins*/
            write_native((char *)LM_UL(MEM(as)));
            break;
        case 1:
    ...

(STonX release 0.8.0 and later already has this function)

2. Switch on STonX debugging output by setting STONX_NATIVE_PRINT to 1
   before building EmuTOS. Do this by creating a file called localconf.h
   (in the same folder as the EmuTOS Makefile) with one line:
   #define STONX_NATIVE_PRINT 1


Good luck!
