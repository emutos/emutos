Two utilities are available to customize EmuTOS ROM images. These can
be found in the tools directory of the source tree and are also provided
as binaries at https://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/tools.


==== tos-lang-change ====

The tos-lang-change tool runs on Windows, Linux, or macOS.  It allows
you to change the display language and/or input keyboard layout in an
EmuTOS ROM image. The precise effect varies depending on which of the
following situations is in effect:

1. Using a multilanguage EmuTOS ROM on a system with working NVRAM
------------------------------------------------------------------
EmuTOS always sets the language and keyboard according to NVRAM.  There
is no need for the tos-lang-change tool.

2. Using a multilanguage EmuTOS ROM on a system with no NVRAM
-------------------------------------------------------------
This could be the case, for example, when running under an emulator
that provides an emulated ST(e) system.  In this situation, EmuTOS will
normally use English as the output language, with US keyboard support.
To use a different language/keyboard combo, run tos-lang-change as
described below.

3. Using a single-language 512K EmuTOS ROM
------------------------------------------
EmuTOS can only display messages in the language it was compiled for.
Normally, the corresponding keyboard layout will be used for input.
However, although the 512K ROM images are single-language, they contain
multiple input keyboard layouts, and you can change the keyboard layout
to a different language by using the tos-lang-change tool (see below).

4. How to use tos-lang-change
-----------------------------
a) obtain the appropriate EmuTOS ROM image
b) at the command line prompt of your native operating system, enter
	tos-lang-change <rom_image_name>
    (e.g. tos-lang-change etos1024k.img)
c) you'll be prompted with the currently supported language code and
    a list of possible new codes
d) enter the desired new language code; the ROM image will be updated
e) you may now use the modified ROM image

NOTE: the type of video is always set according to the display language:
NTSC for US, PAL for everyone else.


==== boot-delay ====

During bootup, most Atari TOS versions provide a boot delay to allow
slow hard disk devices to come up to speed.  Because EmuTOS frequently
runs on emulators or with fast devices, it normally does not have a
builtin boot delay.

If you are running on real hardware with slower devices, you may wish
to add a boot delay.  The boot-delay tool allows you to set a boot
delay value (or display the current boot delay value) in an EmuTOS
ROM image.  The boot-delay tool runs on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

How to use boot-delay
---------------------
a) obtain the desired EmuTOS ROM image
b) at the command line prompt of your native operating system, enter
	boot-delay <rom_image_name>
to display the current delay value, or
	boot-delay <rom_image_name> <new-delay>
to change the value, where
	<rom_image_name> is the filename of the image to be changed
	<new delay> is the desired delay in seconds (1-255) or 0 to disable
c) you may now use the modified ROM image
