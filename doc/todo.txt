BIOS/XBIOS/BDOS
- implement XBIOS calls
- implement Line-A functions
- merge identical headers, and put them all in an include directory (?)
- reduce the number of 'extern' in .c files
- check that RAM disks work
- misc. TODOs in floppy.c
- use extended argv specification in EmuCON
- check that VEC_CRITICALERR (0x101) is called when the BIOS encounters errors
- should hitting control-c terminate the current process? if so, how?
- move mem-only routines out of proc.c into umem.c or iumem.c
- EmuCON should allow 'exit' in .BAT scripts?
- improve Mediach()
- implement full XHDI 1.30
- loop callibration needed for various delays in centronics and DMA ports
- bdos/time.c: Use XBIOS time functions instead of date_time().

Internationalisation
- fix rsc sizes to some reasonable default sizes for all languages ?
  (or dynamically resize the dialogs ???)
- bugs in tools/bug.c; more things should be configurable on the command line

VDI
- Check the various assembler routines that are called from C functions
  if they save and restore enough registers.
- The linemask for dashed lines is not calculated correct, depending on 
  the internal calculations of increase in x direction, like in original TOS.
- It seems so that it is not possible to change the color palette at the moment

AES
- Check if all strings in desk_rsc.c and gem_rsc.c are fully ROM save (the
  TEDINFO strings etc).

DESK
- Add a dialog for resolution switching
- Add a dialog for formating floppy disks
- Support for loading DESKTOP.INF (needs remapping of the icon indices)
