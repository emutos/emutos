BIOS/XBIOS/BDOS
- implement XBIOS calls
- implement linea functions
- merge identical headers, and put them all in an include directory (?)
- check that RAM disks work (an easy way to test bdos under STonX)
- misc. TODOs in floppy.c
- VDI: code cleanup, Makefile, esclisa and gsxvars like in EmuTOS
- auto programs are not run after reset
- use extended argv specification in EmuCON
- check that VEC_TIMER (vector number 0x100) is called by bios every 50th sec
- check that VEC_CRITICALERR (0x101) is called when the BIOS encounters errors
- should hitting control-c terminate the current process? if so, how?
- move mem-only routines out of proc.c into umem.c or iumem.c
- check that EmuCON understands 'exit' (useful in .BAT scripts)
- improve Mediach()
- implement full XHDI 1.30
- add proper VIDEL init and selectable resolutions
- boot from C: (and make it selectable)
- Alt key pressed during boot should skip harddisk driver init
- rewrite nvram.c so it wouldn't need balloc(50) (no checksum necessary)
- move nvram_init to machine_detect so it could be used in screen.c:videl_init
- CPU cache to be made invalid after Pexec has loaded a program in memory ???
- loop callibration needed for various delays in centronics and DMA ports

Internationalisation
- examine how to build a mono-country EmuTOS 192k ROM 
- translate AES strings
- fix rsc sizes to some reasonable default sizes for all languages ?
  (or dynamically resize the dialogs ???)

VDI
- Check the various assembler routines that are called from C functions
  if they save and restore enough registers.
- Bug in mouse painting code. The mouse coordinates are clipped right,
  but not drawn, if vertical rez > 400

AES
- desk_rsc.c and gem_rsc.c are not fully ROM save yet (the TEDINFO strings etc)
- automatically display drives as set in drvbits ?
