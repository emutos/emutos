General
- the source cannot currently be compiled with the following warning flags:
    -Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes
  because certain files (e.g. bdosmain.c) deliberately omit parameter lists.

BIOS/XBIOS
- implement missing XBIOS calls
  (e.g. the Blitter, Falcon DSP functions)
- reduce the number of 'extern' in .c files
- check that RAM disks work
- misc. TODOs in floppy.c
- implement full XHDI 1.30
- let EmuTOS set up correct MMU tree on 68040 (?)

BDOS (GEMDOS)
- move mem-only routines out of proc.c into umem.c or iumem.c

Internationalization
- bugs in tools/bug.c; more things should be configurable on the command line

VDI
- The linemask for dashed lines is not calculated correct, depending on
  the internal calculations of increase in x direction, like in original TOS.

AES

DESK
- Add a dialog for configuring the NVRAM (keyboard, languages, ...)
- Support for loading DESKTOP.INF (needs remapping of the icon indexes)

CLI
