BIOS/XBIOS
- implement missing XBIOS calls
  (e.g. the Blitter, Falcon Videl and TT shifter video functions)
- add support for Falcon RGB screen modes
- merge identical headers, and put them all in the include directory
  (in progress as of end-September 2011)
- reduce the number of 'extern' in .c files
- check that RAM disks work
- misc. TODOs in floppy.c
- check that VEC_CRITICALERR (0x101) is called when the BIOS encounters errors
- improve Mediach()
- implement full XHDI 1.30
- loop callibration needed for various delays in centronics and DMA ports
- for some reasons, the initial stack size (SUPSIZ in bios/startup.S) must be
  bigger than 6000 words, or GFA Basic and MiNT will crash. This should be
  fixed (so much space is really not needed here!).
- make EmuTOS MMU aware and let it set up correct MMU tree

BDOS (GEMDOS)
- should hitting control-c terminate the current process? if so, how?
- move mem-only routines out of proc.c into umem.c or iumem.c

Internationalisation
- bugs in tools/bug.c; more things should be configurable on the command line

VDI
- The linemask for dashed lines is not calculated correct, depending on 
  the internal calculations of increase in x direction, like in original TOS.
- vs_color and vq_color don't work with TT shifter and Falcon Videl yet.

AES
- Check if all strings in desk_rsc.c and gem_rsc.c are fully ROM save (the
  TEDINFO strings etc).
- Add proper support for screen resolution switching.

DESK
- Add a dialog for resolution switching
- Add a dialog for configuring the NVRAM (keyboard, languages, ...)
- Support for loading DESKTOP.INF (needs remapping of the icon indices)

CLI
- use extended argv specification in EmuCON
- EmuCON should allow 'exit' in .BAT scripts?
- Input/Output redirection does not work well (problems with spaces after
  the ">" for example).
