BIOS/XBIOS/BDOS
- implement XBIOS calls
- implement Line-A functions
- merge identical headers, and put them all in an include directory (?)
- reduce the number of 'extern' in .c files
- check that RAM disks work
- misc. TODOs in floppy.c
- check that VEC_CRITICALERR (0x101) is called when the BIOS encounters errors
- should hitting control-c terminate the current process? if so, how?
- move mem-only routines out of proc.c into umem.c or iumem.c
- improve Mediach()
- implement full XHDI 1.30
- loop callibration needed for various delays in centronics and DMA ports
- bdos/time.c: Use XBIOS time functions instead of date_time().

Internationalisation
- fix rsc sizes to some reasonable default sizes for all languages ?
  (or dynamically resize the dialogs ???)
- bugs in tools/bug.c; more things should be configurable on the command line

VDI
- Check the various assembler routines that are called from C functions
  if they save and restore enough registers.
- The linemask for dashed lines is not calculated correct, depending on 
  the internal calculations of increase in x direction, like in original TOS.
- It seems so that it is not possible to change the color palette at the moment

AES
- Check if all strings in desk_rsc.c and gem_rsc.c are fully ROM save (the
  TEDINFO strings etc).
- Windows don't resize/move correctly when EmuTOS is build with UNIQUE=xx (?)

DESK
- Add a dialog for resolution switching
- Add a dialog for formating floppy disks
- Support for loading DESKTOP.INF (needs remapping of the icon indices)

CLI
- Needs a lot of memory due to static buffers ("char buf[10000]" etc.)
- use extended argv specification in EmuCON
- EmuCON should allow 'exit' in .BAT scripts?


Bug report from Eero:
- Could some EmuTOS dialogs be widened so that translations
  fit into them:
  - Delete folders / files dialog
  - Box for the "Soundeffects:" "On" in Preferences dialog
  - Nameconflict dialog (during copy)
- Additionally positioning (beginning) of strings in the disk and folder
  information dialogs is very wierd.  It would be much easier to translate the
  texts if dialog RSC e.g. would expect that each string is of same lenght.
- Format:
  Doesn't do anything.
  I think it should give warning about missing FORMAT program as
  there's such a dialog in the .po file (adding the dialog was also
  mentioned in the todo.txt).   Or it could just say that it removes the
  disk contents, it doesn't reformat it (i.e. does the 'init' command).
- Rename emuconf.inf to end up with .ttp and click to the file:
  EmuTOS says that my machine doesn't have enough memory
  to run the program... (should say that it's not executable)
- If I copy a file twice from one dir to another, I don't get the name
  conflict dialog.  If I do it within the same dialog, I get the error
  dialog.
