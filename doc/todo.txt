BIOS/XBIOS/BDOS
- implement XBIOS calls
- implement linea functions
- merge identical headers, and put them all in an include directory (?)
- reduce the number of 'extern' in .c files
- check that RAM disks work
- misc. TODOs in floppy.c
- VDI: code cleanup, Makefile, esclisa and gsxvars like in EmuTOS
- auto programs are not run after reset
- use extended argv specification in EmuCON
- check that VEC_TIMER (vector number 0x100) is called by bios every 50th sec
- check that VEC_CRITICALERR (0x101) is called when the BIOS encounters errors
- should hitting control-c terminate the current process? if so, how?
- move mem-only routines out of proc.c into umem.c or iumem.c
- EmuCON should allow 'exit' in .BAT scripts?
- improve Mediach()
- implement full XHDI 1.30
- add proper VIDEL init and selectable resolutions
- boot from C: (and make it selectable)
- Alt key pressed during boot should skip harddisk driver init
- rewrite nvram.c so it wouldn't need balloc(50) (no checksum necessary)
- move nvram_init to machine_detect so it could be used in screen.c:videl_init
- loop callibration needed for various delays in centronics and DMA ports

Internationalisation
- examine how to build a mono-country EmuTOS 192k ROM 
- fix rsc sizes to some reasonable default sizes for all languages ?
  (or dynamically resize the dialogs ???)
- bugs in tools/bug.c; more things should be configurable on the command line
- rework mkheader so that it can help configure things in the Makefile,
  e.g. derive the lang from the COUNTRY, ... (the current assumption
  that COUNTRY == LANG is wrong and should be fixed).

VDI
- Check the various assembler routines that are called from C functions
  if they save and restore enough registers.
- Bug in mouse painting code. The mouse coordinates are clipped right,
  but not drawn, if vertical rez > 400
- The linemask for dashed lines is not calculated correct, depending on 
  the internal calculations of increase in x direction, like in original TOS.

AES
- desk_rsc.c and gem_rsc.c are not fully ROM save yet (the TEDINFO strings etc)
- automatically display drives as set in drvbits ?

DESK
- ability to run TTP with parameters
