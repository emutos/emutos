How resolution change works in the EmuTOS desktop
=================================================

When the user selects resolution change, do_optnmenu() [deskmain.c]
calls resolution_change() [deskrez.c].  Depending on the type of video
support (ST(e)/TT/Falcon) available, either a form_alert() is issued, or
a dialog box is presented to the user.

When the user closes the alert or box, the results are passed back to
do_optnmenu().  If the user selected a change of resolution, do_optnmenu()
issues a shel_write(5) to indicate resolution change; the shel_write()
results in a call to sh_write [gemshlib.c] which sets the globals
gl_changerez and gl_nextrez.  do_optmenu() then exits, returning a value
of TRUE.

As a result, hndl_menu() [deskmain.c] returns TRUE, and its caller (either
hndl_kbd() or hndl_msg() [both in deskmain.c]) also returns TRUE.  This
causes deskmain() [deskmain.c] to return TRUE, and then deskstart()
[deskstart.S] issues Pterm() to terminate the desktop process.

The desktop termination causes control to be returned to sh_ldapp()
[gemshlib.c] and, because gl_changerez is non-zero, sh_ldapp() exits.
This causes sh_main() [gemshlib.c] to return to gem_main() [geminit.c].

In gem_main(), the code checks for gl_changerez and, if non-zero:
  1. issues a Setscreen(), with resolution and videomode set according
     to the values of gl_changerez and gl_nextrez,
  2. reinitialises the palette(s) via a call to initialise_palette_registers()
     [screen.c],
  3. returns to its caller, gem_start() [gemstart.S].
gem_start() checks for gl_changerez set and if so, branches back to the
aes_restart label, which clears the global area, and calls gem_main(),
restarting the desktop.
