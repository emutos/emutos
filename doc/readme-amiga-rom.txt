EmuTOS - Amiga ROM version

This EmuTOS version is a ROM for Amiga hardware.

emutos-amiga.rom - English ROM
emutos-kickdisk.adf - English Amiga 1000 Kickstart disk
emutos-vampire.rom - English ROM optimized for Vampire V2 accelerators
emutos-vampire-v4sa.rom - English ROM optimized for Vampire V4 Standalone

The following optional files are also supplied:
emuicon.rsc - contains additional icons for the desktop
emuicon.def - definition file for the above

Note that the emuicon.rsc file format differs from deskicon.rsc used by later
versions of the Atari TOS desktop.

This is a Kickstart ROM replacement.
EmuTOS runs on Amiga hardware, and behaves just like on Atari computers.
This is not an Atari emulator. It is a simple and clean
operating system, which allows running clean Atari programs.
No Atari hardware is emulated, and the full Amiga hardware is available.
The Atari OS calls have been implemented using the Amiga hardware.

To be clear:
- Atari programs using only the OS will work fine
- Atari programs using the hardware (games, demos...) will not work

Note that EmuTOS is totally unrelated to AmigaOS.
No AmigaOS component is required, or even usable.
