Dual keyboard layout support
============================

This is an EmuTOS-unique feature that was introduced in EmuTOS 0.9.5,
and currently applies only to Russian and Greek keyboard layouts.  It
allows the user to switch between two different keyboard layouts on
the fly.

In order to determine whether this feature applies to your setup, you
first need to know that there are two distinct ways that the keyboard
layout may be specified to EmuTOS:

(1) via NVRAM
If you are using a version of EmuTOS that supports NVRAM (such as the
512K or 1024K ROMs), and you are running on a system with NVRAM (such
as the Falcon or TT), the keyboard layout is determined by the NVRAM
keyboard layout byte (location 7 of NVRAM).

(2) via ROM
If you are using a version of EmuTOS that doesn't support NVRAM (for
example, a 256K ROM), or if you are running on a system without NVRAM
(such as an ST or STe), the keyboard layout is determined by the country
for which the ROM is built.

If the keyboard layout indicates a Greek or Russian keyboard, the dual
keyboard layout feature will be active.  For both languages, the default
keyboard layouts generate latin characters at startup.  However, the
user can toggle between this and an alternative character set at any
time, by using a hot key combination (Alt+LeftShift).  For the Greek
keyboard, the alternative character set contains Greek characters; for
the Russian keyboard, it contains Cyrillic characters.
