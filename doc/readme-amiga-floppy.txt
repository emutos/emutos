EmuTOS - Amiga floppy version

This EmuTOS version is a boot floppy for Amiga.

emutos.adf - English Amiga boot floppy
emutos-vampire.adf - Same floppy, optimized for Vampire V2 accelerators

The following optional files are also supplied:
emucurs.rsc - modifiable mouse cursors for the AES/desktop
emucurs.def - definition file for the above
emuicon.rsc - contains additional icons for the desktop
emuicon.def - definition file for the above

Note that the emuicon.rsc file format differs from deskicon.rsc used by later
versions of the Atari TOS desktop.

EmuTOS runs on Amiga hardware, and behaves just like on Atari computers.
This is not an Atari emulator. It is a simple and clean
operating system, which allows running clean Atari programs.
No Atari hardware is emulated, and the full Amiga hardware is available.
The Atari OS calls have been implemented using the Amiga hardware.

To be clear:
- Atari programs using only the OS will work fine
- Atari programs using the hardware (games, demos...) will not work

AmigaOS is only used to load EmuTOS into RAM. Then EmuTOS completely takes
over the machine, and AmigaOS is no more available until reboot.

Unlike the Amiga EmuTOS ROM, these floppies are full-featured by default.
They are the easiest way to test EmuTOS on real hardware.
Floppy emulators such as HxC and Gotek are supported, and even recommended.
