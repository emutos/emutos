Dear Atari Community!


We are happy to announce a new public release of EmuTOS:

EmuTOS 0.9.0 -- February XXth, 2013


INTRODUCTION

EmuTOS is a single-user single-tasking operating system for the 32-bit Atari
computers, clones and emulators. It can be used as a replacement for the TOS
images typically needed today for using emulators and can also run on some
real hardware, like the Atari STe and Falcon, the FireBee, and even Amiga.
All the source code is open and free, licensed under the GNU General Public
License (GPL).



CHANGES SINCE LAST RELEASE

- Added support for real Falcon 030 hardware with EmuTOS-RAM.
- Added support for Amiga hardware (including WinUAE and Blizzard 1260).
- Enabled internal IDE support for all machines, including Falcon.
- Added support for hard disks with Atari, PC, or no partition table.
- Fixed floppy support for DD and HD drives.
- Added support for Falcon and TT SCC serial port
- Many file selector improvements, including drive buttons.
- Fixed support for Hatari extended VDI screens.
- Use the default boot video mode if the NVRAM value is unsupported.
- Center the welcome screen screen vertically.
- Fixed the welcome screen key repeat bug when booting FreeMiNT.
- Changed GEM alerts to conform to standard TOS alert line length.
- Always center dialogs, even with high resolutions.
- Implemented fsel_exinput(), now appl_init() returns AES version as 1.40.
- Fixed vq_color() & vs_color() for systems with VIDEL.
- Fixed crash with BIOS/XBIOS functions numbers >32767.
- Fixed Mediach() return value when there is no floppy.
- Fixed the return value of VIDEL XBIOS functions when there is no VIDEL.
- Fixed latent bug in blkdev_rwabs() when transferring >32767 sectors.
- Added Bconmap() support.
- Fixed Rsconf() return value.
- Fixed Setscreen() to clear the screen on video mode change.
- Protobt(): add new disk types and fix checksum & serial number.
- Flopfmt(): added support for the skew array introduced in TOS 1.04.
- Fixed swapping of Bcostat() for IKBD and MIDI.
- Fixed Falcon palette initialisation.
- Enabled instruction, data cache and MMU on 68030.
- Fixed _SWI cookie to set high order bytes to zeros.
- Added FOLDRxxx.PRG message when internal OS memory is exhausted.
- Consistent cold/warm reset behaviour.
- Fixed EmuCON MV command to move rather than copy.
- Changed Greece country from 18 to 31 to match FreeMiNT standard.
- Added internal gem.rsc and icon.rsc files, with resource decompilers.
- Many internal bugfixes and cleanups.
- Added compilation support for the m68k-elf toolchain.
- Added debug symbols for Hatari in etos512.sym.

DESCRIPTION

EmuTOS is basically made up of six subsystems:

- The BIOS, which is the basic input output system
- The XBIOS, which provides the interface to the hardware
- The BDOS, which are the high level OS routines, what you know as GEMDOS
- The VDI, the virtual device interface - means the screen driver
- The AES, the application environment services or window manager
- The desktop, which is the graphical shell to the user

The BIOS and XBIOS code is our own development. It is really written from
scratch and implements nearly all of the TOS 1.0 BIOS functionality, and a
bit more, like e.g. hard disk access.

The GEMDOS part is based on Digital Research's GEMDOS sources, which were
made available under GPL license in 1999 by Caldera. 

The graphical parts like VDI and AES are now more or less fully
implemented. They work in all the graphics modes of the original Atari
ST. On some emulators EmuTOS can be patched to work with much bigger
screen resolutions without any problems.

The desktop is not as nice as the original one, but is pretty usable
now for a start. You are free to use a more advanced desktop
replacement any time, like TeraDesk for example.

Since EmuTOS just implements the TOS's functionality, you might want to
use MiNT on it in order to run more modern software. EmuTOS is not an
alternative to MiNT. But EmuTOS is the only free base OS to boot MiNT.



EMULATION AND FUTURE PLATFORM

EmuTOS and MiNT cooperate well. Both can make use of a standard native
call interface for emulators.
EmuTOS itself still uses this new standard native interface for all its 
supported native functions. When running EmuTOS in an emulator, this
interface will provide access to use the power of the underlying OS kernel.
It may allow using modern graphics cards, provides fast native filesystem 
access and will enable you to use networking with all bells and whistles - 
and many things more you always dreamed of. This all will at first get 
possible on the ARAnyM platform.



HARDWARE

Making EmuTOS running natively on a new hardware platform is more or less
just a question of driver support for EmuTOS. The same for MiNT, if you'd
like to have it running on top of EmuTOS.

This is the currently supported Atari hardware:

- CPU support for m68000, m68010, m68020, m68030, m68040, m68060, ColdFire V4e
- FPU detected
- Memory controller (both ST and Falcon)
- Monitor type detection (mono, RGB or VGA)
- WD 1772 / AJAX Floppy disk controller (write track not tested)
- DMA controller
- MFP
- PSG
- ST shifter
- STE shifter
- VIDEL
- ACIAs, IKBD protocol, mouse
- MegaST Real-Time Clock (set clock not tested)
- NVRAM (including RTC)
- Falcon IDE
- SCC
- The native feature interface to some degree

EmuTOS is also available on some non-Atari hardware:
- Amiga (WinUAE, Amiga 1000, Amiga 1200 with Blizzard 1260)
