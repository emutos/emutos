EmuTOS - PRG versions

These special versions allow EmuTOS to be loaded from the filesystem (floppy
or hard disk) without the need of replacing the system ROM.
This is the simplest way to test EmuTOS on real hardware.
The drawback is less available RAM compared to ROM versions.

The following optional files are also supplied:
emuicon.rsc - contains additional icons for the desktop
emuicon.def - definition file for the above

Note that the emuicon.rsc file format differs from deskicon.rsc used by later
versions of the Atari TOS desktop.

Notes:
- these versions are compatible with any Atari hardware (except the FireBee)
- TT and Falcon 030 are supported
- the language of the Norwegian/Swedish versions is English; however the
  keyboard layouts are Norwegian/Swedish
- when using these versions with a Magnum ST/STE alt-RAM card, the Magnum
  driver for TOS must not have been loaded before running emutos*.prg

For multilanguage version, the default language is English.
It can be changed by setting the NVRAM appropriately.

These special versions have been built using:
make allprg
