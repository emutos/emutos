EmuTOS - 192 kB versions

These ROMs are suitable for the following hardware:
- ST / STf
- Mega ST
- emulators of the above

Unlike other ROM versions, they do NOT autodetect extra hardware, and might not
work on machines with additional hardware. For example, they don't work under
the Hatari emulator's Falcon emulation due to missing VIDEL support.

Each ROM contains a single language:

etos192cz.img - Czech (PAL)
etos192de.img - German (PAL)
etos192es.img - Spanish (PAL)
etos192fi.img - Finnish (PAL)
etos192fr.img - French (PAL)
etos192gr.img - Greek (PAL)
etos192it.img - Italian (PAL)
etos192ru.img - Russian (PAL)
etos192sg.img - Swiss German (PAL)
etos192us.img - English (NTSC)
etos192uk.img - English (PAL)

Due to size limitations, the 192 kB ROMs contains:
- no EmuCON

Since EmuTOS 0.9.1, the 192 kB ROMs contain the same desktop as other variants.
