AES/VDI/Line-A bugs:
- The right side of outline characters are clipped e.g. in "LaserChess",
  "Diamond miner" & "Minigolf" games, and in vditext tester:
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29276993
  This is due to a bug somewhere in the ugly text_blt() assembler
  function in vdi_tblit.S.
- Thick arcs going partly outside of screen have incorrectly
  drawn pixels at top of screen in vdiline tester.
- In "MathMaze" and "The Ultimate Minesweeper", game win and score
  dialogs leave left/bottom outline on screen when they close.
- Line-A polygons are one pixel short at both sides.  This is
  because clc_flit() function does it for VDI (where perimeter
  is drawn separately).  It is visible e.g. in "Japlish" game.

Desktop bugs:
- Sometimes, if ^C is pressed during a "Show file" operation, the menu
  may subsequently refuse to drop down, and a reboot is required to
  fix the situation.  This will be fixed in the next release.

Video problems:
- Omega's XiTec presentations "swing.prg" throws privilege exception
  on exit.  Both TOS v3 & EmuTOS survive that OK, but in EmuTOS both
  screen and mouse acceleration are messed up: EmuTOS exception restore
  is missing videomode & mouse reset.

Atari Falcon / TOS v4 compatibility bugs:
- Escape Paint icons don't show in image operations window and their
  place in toolbar window is inverted on mouse click.
- Falcon FalcAMP button icons aren't visible as EmuTOS doesn't support
  new style RSC files with CICONs.

Problems that also occur in Atari TOS:
- VDI: when drawing a wide polyline with squared ends and more than one
  segment, if the width of the line is greater than twice the length of
  an ending segment, the end will have a bump rather than being square.
  This is because wideline segments are joined by using filled circles
  whose radius is half the width of the line: the bump is a protruding
  part of the circle that joins the end segment to the previous one.
