Some coding guidelines for EmuTOS
=================================
This file is about coding for EmuTOS.  Like all such documents, it is
out-of-date and incomplete.  Please feel free to suggest updates!


Rules for the format of source files
====================================
- all non-binary files must have Unix line endings (i.e. lf-only NOT cr/lf or cr-only)

- there must be no hard TABs in C/assembler source files (.c, .h and .S)

- lines must not end with trailing spaces


Rules for C coding
==================
- use an indentation of 4 spaces

- the code must compile without errors using the current 'standard'
  compiler & cross-compiler versions and flags (see the WARNFLAGS
  makefile variable in particular)

- different modules are (alas) written using different coding styles,
  particularly with respect to the placement of braces {}.  when
  modifying a module, try to follow the existing format of that module.

- avoid cpp tricks that do not respect brace balancing, like:

  instead of     please do    |  instead of     please do
                              |
  if( a &&    |  if( a        |  foo_t a = {  | foo_t a = {
  #if FOO     |  #if FOO      |    1,         |   1,
      foo )   |     && foo    |  #if FOO      | #if FOO
  #else       |  #else        |    2};        |   2,
      bar )   |     && bar    |  #else        | #else
  #endif      |  #endif       |    4};        |   4,
     ...      |    ) ...      |  #endif       | #endif
              |               |               | };

Also, when in doubt please refer to the file doc/old_code.txt, which
contains a summary of bugs linked to old C code and ways to fix them.


Rules for assembler coding
==========================

(1) Compatibility with C code
-----------------------------
As a general rule, ensure that external functions and variables can be
accessed from C language code. To achieve this:
- name external symbols with a leading underscore;
- make sure external functions use CDECL conventions
  o parameters passed on the stack,
  o registers saved except d0-d1/a0-a1,
  o return value in d0

When TOS specifications (or, in special circumstances, considerations of
efficiency) mean that a routine must use register parameters, name this
routine without an underscore and make a glue routine, as in the following
example:
  _my_routine:
     move.w 4(sp),d0
     move.w 6(sp),d1
  my_routine:
     ...
     rts
Here C code would call my_routine(a,b), and assembler code would pass
parameters in D0 and D1.

Exceptions to the 'leading underscore' rule are:
- routines and variables that can only be used from assembler, and whose
  addresses need not be manipulated by C code (for example, the memory
  configuration routines).
  Note: although the exception routines will never be *called* by C code,
  their vectors will be *accessed* by C code, so the vectors must have
  a leading underscore.
- addresses used to represent the names of fields in a structure, for
  example:
    _struct_a:
    structamemberx:  dc.l 1
    structamembery:  dc.l 1
  equivalent to the following C header:
    extern struct {
        long x;
        long y;
    } struct_a;


(2) Processor compatibility
---------------------------
Assembler code must be capable of running on all 680x0 processors as well
as ColdFire.  This means that you should use 68000-only instructions
and addressing modes for code that will be executed on 680x0 processors.
Because ColdFire has restricted address modes for certain instructions
(move.m is a notable example), this may mean that you will have to use
conditional compilation in some cases.

Certain parts of the code may require 680x0 instructions that are not
present on the 68000: for example, processor detection needs this.  These
must be generated via dc.w/dc.l.  In order to reduce the possibility of
mistakes, there are now macros that will generate dc.w/dc.l statements
for some of the commonly-used 680x0 mnemonics: see asmdefs.h for specifics.
