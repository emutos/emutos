Start... early ages

1985-05-16
- GEMDOS 1.0 released by Digital Research, Inc.

1987-06-05  ACH PROC.C
- Problem - After physical disk error COMMAND.PRG gives "Command not
  found." message for all subsequent external commands. Fix - Changed the
  error handling code in  xexec() to always do an ixterm(t); on any disk
  error, thus freeing memory.

1987-06-26  ACH TIME.C & BIOS
- To enable GEMDOS to take advantage of real-time clock/calendars a new
  BIOS function (11h) has been added. Whenever the BDOS sets a new time
  or date this function is called and, if the hardware supports it, the
  real-time clock can be updated. When the BDOS needs the current time or
  date the function is called to allow the BIOS to update the internal
  BDOS values. If there is no hardware clock the BIOS can  simply ignore
  this call as the BDOS still maintains the time and date internally
  based on the system tick.

1987-09-16  ACH SUP.C
- Problem - the internal date and time variables used to time stamp file
  updates are set to 0 when the OS starts up.

  Fix - Changed cinit() in SUP.C to call new BIOS date_time() function
  (11h) so that the BIOS can initialise the internal variables from a 
  hardware real-time clock, if supported.

1987-10-09  ACH BDOSMAIN.C
- Duplicate definition of supstk and SUPSIZ removed from this module.
  (Duplicated in PROC.C and FS.H.) If the supervisor stack is to be OEM 
  configurable some more reliable method must be devised.

1987-11-19  ACH RWA.A
- Added _lbmove, _bfill, _bmove routines. (These were supposed to be in
  something called TOOLS.ARC which was not supplied by DRI.)

- initinfo.c displays current date and time (sorry, no NLS enabled yet!) (joy)

08. Dec. 2001
- NO_IKBD_CLOCK forgot to disable the XBIOS gettime(). Fixed by disabling
  all lowlevel IKBD functions. STonX boots EmuTOS again. (joy)

28. Dec. 2001
- added Falcon memconf routine (joy)
- corrected the memtop in the memconf clear routine to 14MB (joy)
- added memval3 check/set (joy)
- added ramtop/ramvalid set (no FastRAM for now) (joy)
- added run-time check for Falcon MMU that fires a bus error
  on non-Falcon machines. This makes use of stack so the notice
  in bios/startup.S about meminit not using sp is not correct (joy)
- updated status.txt (the hw init paragraph) (joy)

31. Dec. 2001
- added FastRAM (TT-RAM) detection to bios/memory.S. Right now
  it is called if Falcon MMU was detected but generally I need
  to detect CPU type so it would work on TT as well. (joy)

  needs stack pointer - for both the bus error handler and for
  occasionals bsr kprintf (joy)

- changed an explicit tab into \t in a string in command.c (LVL)
- made cvsready (LVL)

2002-01-06
- fixed BAD bug in fsmain.c - the divmod() long number (byte offset of lseek)
  was stripped when converting to (int). Due to that relocation info couldn't
  be read from a file during Pexec() and that caused "invalid exec format"
  bugs. Actually most things in BDOS filesystem could never work! (joy)
- "061a executable file format" debug print corrected: "601a ..." (joy)

2002-01-06
- optimized divmod() and moved it to bdos/fsio.c (MAD) 
- did put usr2xfr/xfr2usr to bdos/fsio.c too (MAD)

  'volatile LONG frclock;' inside the routine. (LVL)
- updated fr translations (LVL)

2002-01-09
- bug now tells the number of untranslated entries in po files (LVL)
- make ikbd.dsm creates the 'gcc -S' output of file bios/ikbd.c (LVL)
- initinfo logo code rewritten: it's easier to change the picture now (LVL)
- initinfo messages displayed properly (the fore and back colors were
  not inited) - still the colors should probably be inited elsewhere (LVL)
- bell() and keyclick() now use TOS vars bell_hook and kcl_hook (LVL)
- added general block device functions in bios/blkdev.c (MAD)
- german translation updated (MAD)
- added doc/bugs.txt, entries from doc/todo.txt (MAD)

2002-01-10
- bios/floppy.c: renamed flop_hdv_boot to flop_bootcheck
                 renamed do_hdv_boot to flop_hdv_boot 
                 should boot now after warmstart... (MAD)

2002-01-13
- bios/floppy.c: moved BIOS functions (rwabs, getbpb, mediach) to blkdev.c
                 moved geometry from finfo to blkdev struct
                 moved last_access to devices struct
                 moved FATfs bootsector struct to blkdev.h
                 moved compute_cksum() to blkdev.c
                 added floppy_rw() (that's the lowlevel part of floppy_rwabs)
                 added (WORD dev) to flopunlk() in order to update last_access
                 added hackish init of floppy geometry to flopini() (joy)
- bios/floppy.h: disabled bpb struct
                 made getiword externally accessible (joy)
- bios/startup.S: added ara_DMAread() (for calling the aranym's DMAread) (joy)
- bios/tosvars.h: added long recnr parameter to rwabs (like AHDI 3.0) (joy)
- bios/bios.c: added long recnr parameter to bios_4 (like AHDI 3.0) (joy)
- bios/bios.h: enabled bpb struct (joy)
- bios/xbios.c: DMAread()/DMAwrite() implemented (joy)
- Makefile: added disk.c to source files (joy)
- bios/disk.[ch] created, DMAread()/DMAwrite() implemented (joy)
- bios/blkdev.c: deleted most of Martin's framework
                 added full AHDI 3.0 extended Rwabs() (yet to add MEDIACH check)
                 added getBPB() with auto 12/16-bit FAT detection
                 added Mediach() (same as was in floppy.c) (joy)
- bios/blkdev.h: blkdev structure reworked (maybe a bit too much)
                 bpb structure disabled - what's wrong with the bios.h one?
                 UNIT and PARTITION structures - first ideas, incomplete (joy)
- Comment: the only thing I am sure of is the Rwabs() implementation. I am not
           very sure about the blkdev/device concept. Also would need to set
           common language - how to call physical drive (unit? device? drive?)
           and how to call logical disk (C:, partition, disk?). The problem
           now is how many things can be detected during boot - the size of 
           partition, of the whole drive (especially with floppy) etc.
           bdos/fsio.c still strikes - passes null pointer for rwabs buffer.
           That needs to be debugged (or maybe rewritten completely). (joy)
- updated po/de.po, because of stupid translations by me (MAD)

2002-01-14

- bios/detect.S: functions now keep register a2 intact (LVL)
- bios/kprint.c: temporarily removed console print in panic, until one
  knows of a way to be certain that the concole is configured (LVL)

  them in util/string.c and include/string.h; merged btools.h with
  string.h to be consistent with standard ANSI C (LVL)

- in bios/vectors.S, init_user_vec no longer relies on the previous value of 
  register a1 from init_exc_vec (LVL)
- bios/blkdev.c - the floppy_init does not use the hdv_init vector. A: works
  under STonX again. (joy)
- bios/bios.c - increased the fixed size sector cache to 4kB sector. That's
  enough for partitions smaller than 512MB. Ideally it should be 32kB (joy).

- in bios/lineainit.c there is now the sysfonts array for linea.
  font_ring is not longer used by linea (MAD).
- keyboard reset (Alt+Ctrl+Del(+RShift)) implemented (joy)
- trying to get 16-bit sector number working in BDOS - one workaround
  in fsbuf.c makes DIR (fsfirst/fsnext) working correctly (it seems).
  The NEGATIVE_RECN value (currently -200) should be fixed when it will be
  clear what is FAT/DIR negative recn and what is unsigned recn in signed int.
  FAT traversing seems to be broken (Pexec fails for some files) (joy)
- blkdev.h: retrying in emulator is not necessary (joy)

  for reference, but ultimately it will go away. Fastram is allocated when 
  requested but it is still not freed (the *term routines in proc need to
  be changed as well); Pexec() flag 6 supported. I did not test on Fastram but
  all of autoexec, EmuCON, loading progs from C: and A: work. (LVL)

  early() and new machine_init() creates cookies etc. (joy)
- screen.c now detects proper screen size from VIDEL registers - there's no
  more trash on the screen - the size is set to 640x480 (joy)
- lineainit.c sets the variables according to proper screen resolution (joy)
- fixed BDOS 16-bit FAT - integer computing was overflowing in fsdrive.c (joy)

2002-01-30

  enabled at the time when disk initialisation occurred) (LVL)
- added limited parallel port implementation (output only) (LVL)
- indented some files (LVL)
- bios/floppy.c: FastRAM floppy read/write (FRB usage was read-only);

  better this way with most applications (THH).

  the original GEM's DESKTOP.INF. Added automatic drive scanning when there
  is no such file, too. (THH)
- aes/gemfmlib.c - Dialogs can now be left by pressing ENTER, too. (THH)

2002-07-30
- vdi/gsxasm*.c - Fixed bug in VDI that sometimes wrote to ROM area (THH).
- aes/crysbind.h - Size of the addr_in array was not big enough for
  fsel_exinput(). Now this AES call should work, too. (THH)

- bios/startup.S - Filled the remaining empty ROM header entries (THH).
- aes/gemasm.S - Accessories are now working on CPUs >= 68010, too! (THH).
- bios/fntlat2_*.c - Czech language okay (make COUNTRY=cz) but file now is
  too big for 256k: comment out another country in po/LINGUAS to try out
  cz country on a <256k emulator; UNIQUE cz does not work yet (LVL)
- bios/startup.S - deleted unused function vidchng() (MAD)

2002-09-11
- bios/startup.S - added NatFeat detection code (joy)
- bios/bios.c - added 'int native_features' flag (please move elsewhere as 
  appropriate - it's definitely not bios related but will be used mostly
  there) (joy)
- bios/disk.c - adapted to NatFeat. Finally clean XHDI interface that other
  emulators may follow. (joy)
- bios/machine.c - a very hackish code for reading NF_NAME in place
  of emulated machine name. Where to get a bit of free RAM? Please fix it.
  (joy)
- bios/initinfo.c - added 5 seconds delay so users can enjoy machine name.
  The waiting is not using CPU STOP insn yet. Also needs to be
  interruptable by a keypress. Would be nice if it was possible to jump
  to the EmuShell instead of booting the GEM by pressing a key. (joy)

2002-09-14
- desk/icons - removed unnecessary 48x24 icons, added sed scripts to help edit
  icons (LVL)
- desk/desk_rsc.c - menu items are automatically adjusted to the right size

  some redundancy as I can't figure yet how to avoid duplication between
  country.mk and country.c (LVL)

               - get_pix() for linea reimplemented in C (MAD)
               - rectfill() implemented in C (MAD)

2002-09-20
- vdi/monout.c - abline() bugs fixed. Thanks, Johan! (MAD)

2002-09-21 
- vdi/tranfm.S - vr_trnfm() implemented in assembler (MAD)
- vdi/monout.c - rectfill() in C (MAD)
               - habline() uses same sub-routines as rectfill() (MAD)
- vdi/gsxasm1.S - concat() moved to gsxasm2.S, where it is used (MAD)

2002-09-22 
- vdi/monout.c - replaced asm vr_trnfm() by Johan's impl. in C (MAD)
               - fixed bugs in horizontal line drawing modes (MAD)
- vdi/tranfm.S - removed from compile in Makefile (MAD)

2002-09-25 
- vdi/monout.c - fixed bug in color setting (MAD)

2002-09-27 
- vdi/monout.c - optimized horzline() and rectfill()  (MAD)

2002-09-29
- make etoscpr.img makes experimental compressed-RAM-inside-ROM (LVL)
- use make comprtest to test the compressor (LVL)
- bios/memory.s - debug messages optional (LVL)
- added -pedantic to $(NATIVECC) options, killed some warnings in tools (LVL)

2002-09-30
- tools/compr.c et al - added a header in the compressed data, for a cleaner
  handling of the destination address in ROM (LVL)
- Makefile - code factorisation, various optimisations, foo.dsm is 
  desassembly for foo.img (LVL)
- util/comprtst.sh - changed . t into sh -f t for portability (LVL)
- doc/status.txt - changed the table of supported emulators, to include date 
  of update of individual entries (LVL)
- doc/install.txt - documented some of the current makefile targets (LVL)

2002-10-05
- renamed _FOO_H into H_FOO_ for standard C compliance (I kept the script 
  which did it in case anybody wants to change back or again) (LVL)
- bdos/time.[ch] - regrouped stuff here, and connected it to _evt_timer (LVL)
- bdos/rwa.S - removed some useless remnants, osinit now in C (LVL)
- vectors.S - unused vectors _int_timera, ... deleted; priv and illg now
  correctly jump to the default exception vector (LVL)
- tosvars.h, vdimain.c - etv_timer gets an int argument (LVL)
- bios.c - commented out illegal error setting, as I don't think it does the
  right thing [changing a move SR, to CCR, is done by the priv stuff] (LVL)

2002-10-12
- merged tools/keytbl2c and util/dumpkbd.c - now dumpkbd.prg directly 
  generates keyb_xx.h (LVL)
- Makefile - fixed a bug in make depend (LVL)

2002-10-13
- renamed font files, to allow a systematic handling of fonts (LVL)
- bios/country.c - tables now generated from country.mk in bios/ctables.h (LVL)
- Makefile - introduced $(TOCLEAN) that gradually stores the name of files 
  to be removed when doing make clean, to make it harder to forget files
  in make clean (LVL)
- doc/country.txt - updated, but still not entirely satisfactory (LVL)

2002-10-14
- Makefile - some more optimisations: removed tedious $(PBIOSCSRC) stuff;
  less sub-processes are launched (e.g. grep | sed | sort | sort replaced
  by the more logical sed | sort ... sometimes you just see when things
  were done (by me!) just using a trial and error method) (LVL)
- portab.h - removed commented-out and some seldom used macros. Ultimately
  I would like to replace NULL-used-to-mean-char-zero by '\0' and have
  NULL and NULLPTR be ((void*)0). Then we could replace NULLPTR by NULL and
  forget about NULLPTR... (LVL)

2002-10-18
- genctables.awk - portable awk, country names need not be 2 chars long (LVL)
- bios/processor.[hS] - 68040 instruction cache stuff (LVL)
- bdos/proc.c - instruction cache invalidation on pexec (LVL)
- bios/vectors.S - illegal instruction handler now changes move-from-CCR to
  move-from-SR (LVL)
- bios/bios.c - illegal instruction handler only called on a bare 68000 (LVL)
- Makefile - if a file local.mk is found, it will be included at the end just 
  before targets clean and distclean, for optional individual targets (LVL)
- ikbd.[ch] - dead keys (see keyb_fr.h for an example of how to configure 
  the keyboard to use it); ALT-keypad to enter chars by decimal numbers (LVL)
- added "%p" in printf format string to print pointers as 0x%08lx (LVL)
- changed again H_FOO_ to FOO_H (sorry about this, I won't change it 
  a third time) (LVL)
- include/config.h - removed "i18nconf.h" from there, as it caused trouble 
  with tools needing "string.h" but not "i18nconf.h" (LVL)

2002-10-19
- bios/bios.c - display initinfo before you start booting from a device
  so that users have time to press and hold the Alt key to skip the boot (joy)
- bios/blkdev.c - added check for the Alt key (joy)
- bios/initinfo.c - can't display the boot device - it's unknown ATM (joy)
- bios/bios.c - check for Ctrl key fixed (hold it to skip AUTO\*.PRG) (joy)
- bios/initinfo.c - delay can be interrupted by Shift/Ctrl/Alt keys (joy)
- bios/cookie.c - number of free slots corrected (joy)
- bios/machine.c - COOKIE_NATFEAT created (joy)
- bios/startup.S, bios/disk.c, bios/machine.c - NatFeat instruction codes
  changed to LineF $fe00/$fe01 (joy)

2002-10-20
- bios/startup.S, bios/disk.c, bios/machine.c - NatFeat instruction codes
  changed back to good old $7300/$7301. The LineF interface requires
  the $fe0x instructions to be long words and I am not ready to accept
  such change of NatFeat calling convention. Sorry. (joy)

2002-10-28
- bios/bios.c - loading of AUTO folder programs displayed on stderr console
  via new NF_STDERR (sorry for the mess in bios.c, the nf calling must be
  cleaned up somehow). (joy)

2002-10-31
- Makefile - changed, so that vdi/lisaesc.S is used again (MAD)
- aes/gemdosif.S - changed to lowercase and put _back after entry (MAD)

2002-11-02
- aes/geminit.c - held Ctrl key causes not loading the ACCs (joy)

2002-11-03
- bios/xhdi.[ch] - XHDI implemented - allows running FreeMiNT (joy)
- bios/disk.c - some functions moved to the xhdi.c (joy)
- bios/blkdev.c - initialization order changed (joy)
- bios/machine.c - add XHDI cookie to the jar (joy)
- bios/startup.S - XHDI entry point (joy)
- bios/initinfo.c - missing #include (joy)

2002-11-07
- util/intmath.c - central impl. of (s)mul_div()    (MAD)
- aes/gemdosif.h - change tikaddr and tiksav to void *  (MAD)

2002-11-09
- aes/gemgsxif.c - changed i_lptr1 to use just one argument (MAD)

2002-11-16
- aes/gemdisp.c - schedule() loop now sleeps with the STOP #2300 insn (joy)

2002-11-22
- vdi/vdimain.c - change timer vectors to be used as pointers (MAD)

2003-01-13
- bios/natfeat.[hS] - NatFeat stuff moved to separate files (joy)
- bios/startup.S, bios/machine.c - cleaned up (joy)
- "__NF" cookie now contains pointer to the NatFeat structure with
  function pointers (joy)

2003-01-14
- bios/vectors.S - the screenpt must be cleared after successful video
  registers update (joy)
- NatFeat calling cleaned up - uses function pointers now (joy)

2003-01-20
- bdos/fsdir.c - Fsfirst/Fsnext nesting fixed. This was a very important
  fix since without this the AUTO folder processing didn't work (Standa)
- bdos/proc.c - local or global variable referenced? Fixed by a wild
  guess (Standa)
- bios/bios.c - restore our DTA when processing the AUTO folder since
  the executed AUTO program could have changed it in the meantime (joy)
- bios/blkdev.c - TOS uses a different algorithm for detecting whether
  a FAT partition is 12-bit or 16-bit. From mtools I understood that
  anything with non-floppy-standard cluster number (probably 720/1440)
  is considered to be 16-bit FAT. Without this patch 4 MB disk image
  formatted with TOS could not be used under EmuTOS. Now fixed (joy)

2003-01-21
- bdos/fsfirst.c - yesterday's patch corrected (Standa)
- bios/bios.c - the Setdta() should not be needed (Standa)

2003-01-29
- bdos/kpgmld.c - cleaned interface with proc.c a little bit (LVL)
- bdos/proc.c - yet another cleanup of the xexec() implementation; there
  should be no memory leak any more in case of IO error, but of course this
  feature is untested as of now (LVL)

2003-02-01
- bios/ikbd.[ch] - dead keys fixed, backspace seems to work okay now (LVL)

2003-02-06
- bios/bios.c - natfeat printing changed back to kprintf (joy)
- bios/screen.[ch] - a routine for programming VIDEL to produce any of
  bitplane modes on VGA monitor with 640x480 res. added. Also proper VIDEL
  reset is now done on init. The last missing thing is to fetch the
  pre-selected boot resolution from the NVRAM and apply it. Until then
  the default boot resolution will be the 2-color mode (joy)

2003-02-07
- bios/natfeats.c, natfeat.h, natfeat.S - general cleanup, library of NF
  functions added (joy)
- bios/kprint.c, kprintasm.S - ARAnyM code removed, NF support added (joy)
- bios/machine.[ch], bios.c - updated for new NF library (joy)
- Makefile, doc/install.txt, include/config.h - updated to support NF (joy)

2003-02-07
- doc/announce.txt - updated for release 0.6 (MAD)

2003-02-08
- bios/natfeats.c - display the short emu name so that initinfo fits in
  40 columns screen resolution (joy)
- aes/geminit.c - check the Control key only once, not before loading each
  accessory. The harddrives are so fast that it doesn't make sense to try
  and skip only some accessories ;-) (joy)
- bios/initinfo.c - corrected displaying of free RAM so it fits in 40 cols.
  Also added a TOS like boot timeout with a little boot guide and a gfx
  effect of countdown :-) (joy)
- include/config.h - #define TIMEOUT_ON_BOOT here or in your localconf.h.
  This was added especially to make Thothy happy - he doesn't like long
  boot timeouts... (joy)
- po/cs.po - Czech translation updated (joy)
- bios/initinfo.c - moved up the time bar a few lines (MAD)
- vdi/esclisa.S - used this instead of buggy vdiesc.c  (MAD)
- bdos/console.c - better code style (MAD)
- vdi/vdiesc.c - used this again  (MAD)
- po/de.po - updated (MAD)

2003-02-09
- doc/annouce.txt - minor english language rewording (LVL)
- po/fr.po - updated (LVL)
- include/version.h - set to 0.6 (LVL)
- include/config.h - added DETECT_NATIVE_FEATURES (I assume it was only in
  joy's localconf.h) and set it to 1 by default. I checked that it works on
  on both non-nf-enabled-yet STonX and on newly-nf-enabled STonC. I suggest
  to get rid of the STonX native print stuff as soon as I commit to STonX the
  quick natfeat implementation I just added to STonC (LVL)
- natfeat_init() called in memory.S, for earlier availability of kprintf (LVL)
- bios/bios.c - DBGAUTOBOOT added so that the AUTO crash is visible (joy)
- bios/ikbd.c - corrected debug typo (joy)

2003-02-10
- bios/bios.c - now using the reentrant trap1_pexec() to load programs (THH)

2003-02-11
- vdi/monout.c - bug in abline's C-implementation found (MAD)
- vdi/*.c - enabled line drawing in C again (MAD)

2003-02-12
- bios/ikbd.c - initial settings of conterm hopefully fixes the hotkeys
  in XaAES (joy)
- Fixed some bugs in EmuCON (for example the initial Mshrink was not working).
  Now it is also possible to quit it with "EXIT" again. (THH)
- EmuCON can now be compiled into EmuTOS together with the AES/Desktop and
  it can even be executed from the Desktop now! (THH)
- tools/bug.c - Added missing include file. (THH)
- util/intmath.c - fixed bug in mul_div, circles work again (MAD)
- po/de.po - updated (MAD)

2003-02-15
- desk/deskapp.c - Icon masks are working now (THH).
- po/fr.po - updated. I think we should put back the EmuCON strings in it, 
  since we now have decided to put back the console in EmuTOS. The size will 
  not be a problem for 512k images, and for other sizes UNIQUE is fine.
  However this will have to wait till I fix bug to bring back old entries 
  into life. (LVL)
- bios/comprimg.S - added natfeat_init stub, converted debug print from STonX
  to NF_STDERR (LVL)
- Makefile - version string deduced from doc/changelog.txt (only partly
  done, the version in the desk info menu is still taken from version.h) (LVL)
- bios/bios.c, natfeat* - NF_SHUTDOWN tried before halting (LVL)

2003-02-18
- bios/screen.c - Falcon VIDEL better supported. Should allow boot in colors
  but there is still something wrong in the EmuTOS as it requires the rez_reg
  to be set (can't find out why) (joy)

2003-02-19
- bios/screen.c - cleaned up the getrez a bit (MAD)

2003-02-20
- bios/screen.[ch] - VIDEL color registers supported, EmuTOS can boot
  in 2, 4 or 16 colors now! (joy)
- bios/screen.[ch] - setphys() safeguard check (joy)
- bios/nvram.c - fixed wrong offset, added static buffer for nvram data (joy)
- bios/machine.c - early initialization of nvram (joy)
- bios/screen.c - make use of NVRAM boot resolution setting. Tested on
  ARAnyM (aranym -e -r <X>) and should work also on real Falcon030. (joy)
- doc/announce.txt - updated for 0.6 release (MAD)

2003-02-21
- bios/lineainit.c - quick patch to get 8x16 font in all resolutions with
  screen height >= 400 (joy)
- include/config.h - boot countdown time increased to 8 seconds (joy)
- po/cs.po - updated (joy)

2003-02-27
- vdi/* - found bug in C-pattern filling, enabled again (MAD)
- Makefile - EmuCON is compiled in by default now (MAD)

2003-03-03
- aes/geminit.c, gemshlib.c : Experimental support for #Z line in EMUDESK.INF
  to start another desktop instead of the ROM desktop. (THH)

2003-03-08
- vdi/mounout.c - fixed bug in clipbox() (MAD)

2003-03-10
- bdos/time.c - implemented Tgettime() and Tgetdate() (MAD)

2003-03-22
- bdos/bdosmain.c - ripped out unused oscnt variable (MAD)
- bdos/bdosmain.c - added two wrappers to avoid compiler warnings (MAD)
- include/bindbios.h - now use fully prototyped inline BIOS bindings (MAD)

2003-03-23
- include/xbindbios.h - now use fully prototyped inline XBIOS bindings (MAD)

2003-04-12
- bios/screen.c - some debug prints (LVL)
- bios/vectors.S - the new palette pointer to load during VBL now erased when
  loaded (previously it was loaded at every VBL!) (LVL)
- include/config.h, bios/kprint.c - kprintf() prints to MIDI out port when
  MIDI_DEBUG_PRINT flag activated (to get debug prints e.g. on Steem) (LVL)
- fixed some .cvsignore files (LVL)

2003-04-13
- bios/sound.c - Fixed a wrong byte in the system bell data. (THH)
- include/xbiosbind.h - Added binding for Dosound(). (THH)
- aes/optimize.c - sound() now really makes sound with Dosound()! (THH)
- bios/biosmem.c - explanatory comment about memtop and membot added (LVL)

2003-04-17
- util/boot.c - removed 192k size limitation in RAMTOS loader (LVL)

2003-04-19
- bdos/proc.c - proc_go() now better documented (LVL)
- tools/mkheader.awk - simpler and smaller replacement of mkheader.c (LVL)
- doc/country.txt - updated following removal of mkheader.c (LVL)
- bios/country.h bios/ctrycodes.h - country codes now in separate file (LVL)
- Makefile - make cvsready now also expands awk files (LVL)
- bios/sound.c - minor comment editing (LVL)
- include/asm.h - removed ints_off()/ints_on() macros as I really think their
  direct use of the stack for storage is unsafe/unportable in conjunction 
  with a C compiler (LVL)
- vdi/*.c - replaced ints_off(); ... ints_on(); by the traditional way:
  WORD old_sr; ... old_sr = set_sr(2700); ... set_sr(old_sr); (LVL)
- util/miscasm.S - gratuitious optimisation (LVL)
- bdos/comprimg.S - fixed syntax error in debug stuff (LVL)
- */*.c - replaced GNU extension '\e' by the proper ANSI '\033' (LVL)
- cli/coma.S - fixed bug preventing EmuCON usage from the desktop (LVL)
- bios/vectors.S - stack restored before jumping in dopanic() (LVL)
- bios/panicasm.S - made panic message a little bit more robust (LVL)
- bios/kprint.c - fixed dopanic() (LVL)

2003-04-21
- bios/initinfo.c bios/bios.c - hitting 'C' during initinfo launches an early
  EmuCON, as a first step towards what Petr really wants (?) (LVL)
- Makefile - bug no longer unnecessarily built when making UNIQUE=us (LVL)
- cli/command.c - implemented prototypes for gemdos bindings (LVL)
- bdos/fs.h - fixed DTA.dt_fname: the correct size is 14 bytes, not 12 (LVL)

2003-04-22
- aes/gemshlib.c, aes/gemstart.S, aes/gemdos.c : Fixed problem with shel_write
  when parameter isover was 0. (shel_write on the Atari-GEM does not execute a
  program directly!). I also included a new dos_exec function that makes the
  handling of the rlr->p_uda->u_spsuper problem much more easier (the new
  dos_exec has basically been taken from the old Lisa-GEM). (THH)

2003-04-24
- aes/gemsuper.c, aes/crysbind.h, aes/gemwmlib.c : Added wind_new() function
  (called wm_new internally). TeraDesk seems now to be working fine. (THH)

2003-05-01
- doc/authors.txt - historic part fixed (LVL)

2003-05-05
- bdos/* - minor header cleaning (LVL)
- desk/desk_rsc.c bios/initinfo.h include/version.h - version consistently
  extracted from the changelog; EmuTOS URL added in about dialog (LVL)
- doc/changelog.txt - converted dates to ISO YYYY-MM-DD format (LVL)
- desk/desk_rsc.c - menu sizes adjusted so that they fit in the screen (LVL)

2003-05-11
- bdos/bdosmain.c : Changed the GEMDOS version to a more reasonable number
  since some programs might depend on this value. (THH)
