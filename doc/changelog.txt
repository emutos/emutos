Start... early ages

16. May. 1985
- GEMDOS 1.0 released by Digital Research, Inc.

05. Jun. 1987  ACH	PROC.C
- Problem - After physical disk error COMMAND.PRG gives "Command not
  found." message for all subsequent external commands. Fix - Changed the
  error handling code in  xexec() to always do an ixterm(t); on any disk
  error, thus freeing memory.

26. Jun. 1987  ACH	TIME.C & BIOS
- To enable GEMDOS to take advantage of real-time clock/calendars a new
  BIOS function (11h) has been added. Whenever the BDOS sets a new time
  or date this function is called and, if the hardware supports it, the
  real-time clock can be updated. When the BDOS needs the current time or
  date the function is called to allow  the BIOS to update the internal
  BDOS values. If there is no hardware clock the BIOS can  simply ignore
  this call as the BDOS still maintains the time and date internally
  based on the system tick.

16. Sep. 1987  ACH	SUP.C
- Problem - the internal date and time variables used to time stamp file
  updates are set to 0 when the OS starts up.

  Fix - Changed cinit() in SUP.C to call new BIOS date_time() function
  (11h) so that the BIOS can initialise the internal variables from a 
  hardware real-time clock, if supported.

09. Oct. 1987 ACH	BDOSMAIN.C
- Duplicate definition of supstk and SUPSIZ removed from this module.
  (Duplicated in  PROC.C and FS.H.) If the supervisor stack is to be OEM 
  configurable some more reliable method must be devised.

19. Nov. 1987 ACH	RWA.A
- Added _lbmove, _bfill, _bmove routines. (These were supposed to be in
  something called TOOLS.ARC which was not supplied by DRI.)

08. Dec. 2001

28. Dec. 2001
- added Falcon memconf routine (joy)
- corrected the memtop in the memconf clear routine to 14MB (joy)
- added memval3 check/set (joy)
- added ramtop/ramvalid set (no FastRAM for now) (joy)
- added run-time check for Falcon MMU that fires a bus error
  on non-Falcon machines. This makes use of stack so the notice
  in bios/startup.S about meminit not using sp is not correct (joy)
- updated status.txt (the hw init paragraph) (joy)

31. Dec. 2001
- added FastRAM (TT-RAM) detection to bios/memory.S. Right now
  it is called if Falcon MMU was detected but generally I need
  to detect CPU type so it would work on TT as well. (joy)
- corrected // notice in bios/startup.S - the meminit actually
  needs stack pointer - for both the bus error handler and for
  occasionals bsr kprintf (joy)

01. Jan. 2002
- FastRAM detection now uses proper CPU check (joy)
- resetvec handling fixed (wrong check 'tst.b resetvec' removed) (joy)

- changed an explicit tab into \t in a string in command.c (LVL)
- made cvsready (LVL)

06. Jan. 2002
- fixed BAD bug in fsmain.c - the divmod() long number (byte offset of lseek)
  was stripped when converting to (int). Due to that relocation info couldn't
  be read from a file during Pexec() and that caused "invalid exec format"
  bugs. Actually most things in BDOS filesystem could never work! (joy)
- "061a executable file format" debug print corrected: "601a ..." (joy)

06. Jan. 2002
- optimized divmod() and moved it to bdos/fsio.c (MAD) 
- did put usr2xfr/xfr2usr to bdos/fsio.c too (MAD)

- disabled vsync() neverending loop (MonST works now) (joy)
- fixed LineA v_bytes_lin variable (Clocky works now) (joy)

  'volatile LONG frclock;' inside the routine. (LVL)
- updated fr translations (LVL)

09. Jan. 2002
- bug now tells the number of untranslated entries in po files (LVL)
- make ikbd.dsm creates the 'gcc -S' output of file bios/ikbd.c (LVL)
- initinfo logo code rewritten: it's easier to change the picture now (LVL)
- initinfo messages displayed properly (the fore and back colors were
  not inited) - still the colors should probably be inited elsewhere (LVL)
- bell() and keyclick() now use TOS vars bell_hook and kcl_hook (LVL)
- added general block device functions in bios/blkdev.c (MAD)
- german translation updated (MAD)
- added doc/bugs.txt, entries from doc/todo.txt (MAD)

10. Jan. 2002
- bios/floppy.c: renamed flop_hdv_boot to flop_bootcheck
                 renamed do_hdv_boot to flop_hdv_boot 
                 should boot now after warmstart... (MAD)

13. Jan. 2002
- bios/floppy.c: moved BIOS functions (rwabs, getbpb, mediach) to blkdev.c
                 moved geometry from finfo to blkdev struct
                 moved last_access to devices struct
                 moved FATfs bootsector struct to blkdev.h
                 moved compute_cksum() to blkdev.c
                 added floppy_rw() (that's the lowlevel part of floppy_rwabs)
                 added (WORD dev) to flopunlk() in order to update last_access
                 added hackish init of floppy geometry to flopini() (joy)
- bios/floppy.h: disabled bpb struct
                 made getiword externally accessible (joy)
- bios/startup.S: added ara_DMAread() (for calling the aranym's DMAread) (joy)
- bios/tosvars.h: added long recnr parameter to rwabs (like AHDI 3.0) (joy)
- bios/bios.c: added long recnr parameter to bios_4 (like AHDI 3.0) (joy)
- bios/bios.h: enabled bpb struct (joy)
- bios/xbios.c: DMAread()/DMAwrite() implemented (joy)
- Makefile: added disk.c to source files (joy)
- bios/disk.[ch] created, DMAread()/DMAwrite() implemented (joy)
- bios/blkdev.c: deleted most of Martin's framework
                 added full AHDI 3.0 extended Rwabs() (yet to add MEDIACH check)
                 added getBPB() with auto 12/16-bit FAT detection
                 added Mediach() (same as was in floppy.c) (joy)
- bios/blkdev.h: blkdev structure reworked (maybe a bit too much)
                 bpb structure disabled - what's wrong with the bios.h one?
                 UNIT and PARTITION structures - first ideas, incomplete (joy)
- Comment: the only thing I am sure of is the Rwabs() implementation. I am not
           very sure about the blkdev/device concept. Also would need to set
           common language - how to call physical drive (unit? device? drive?)
           and how to call logical disk (C:, partition, disk?). The problem
           now is how many things can be detected during boot - the size of 
           partition, of the whole drive (especially with floppy) etc.
           bdos/fsio.c still strikes - passes null pointer for rwabs buffer.
           That needs to be debugged (or maybe rewritten completely). (joy)
- updated po/de.po, because of stupid translations by me (MAD)

14. Jan. 2002
- foreground color now inited in lineainit.c (LVL)

- set the C: in drvbits for the hacked up host access disk drive (joy)

15. Jan 2002
- disabled the bmem_allowed bug what Petr found in bios/biosmem.c (MAD)
- bios/detect.S: functions now keep register a2 intact (LVL)
- bios/kprint.c: temporarily removed console print in panic, until one
  knows of a way to be certain that the concole is configured (LVL)

  them in util/string.c and include/string.h; merged btools.h with
  string.h to be consistent with standard ANSI C (LVL)
- bios/kprint.h: silly debug macro HERE kprintf()s the location in file (LVL)
- bios/bios.c: commented out VEC_ILLEGAL = brkpt; (LVL)

- bios/conout.S: fixed bconout5(c) bug when c >= 128 (LVL)
- removed obsolete bios/keyboard.h include/btools.h (LVL)
- in bios/vectors.S, init_user_vec no longer relies on the previous value of 
  register a1 from init_exc_vec (LVL)
- bios/blkdev.c - the floppy_init does not use the hdv_init vector. A: works
  under STonX again. (joy)
- bios/bios.c - increased the fixed size sector cache to 4kB sector. That's
  enough for partitions smaller than 512MB. Ideally it should be 32kB (joy).

16. Jan. 2002

  fr.po and de.po (LVL)

- documented all tosvars in bios/tosvar.h till 0x5b0 (MAD)

20. Jan. 2002
- in bios/lineainit.c there is now the sysfonts array for linea.
  font_ring is not longer used by linea (MAD).
- keyboard reset (Alt+Ctrl+Del(+RShift)) implemented (joy)
- trying to get 16-bit sector number working in BDOS - one workaround
  in fsbuf.c makes DIR (fsfirst/fsnext) working correctly (it seems).
  The NEGATIVE_RECN value (currently -200) should be fixed when it will be
  clear what is FAT/DIR negative recn and what is unsigned recn in signed int.
  FAT traversing seems to be broken (Pexec fails for some files) (joy)
- blkdev.h: retrying in emulator is not necessary (joy)
- blkdev.c: 16-bit recn should work now (joy)

  for reference, but ultimately it will go away. Fastram is allocated when 
  requested but it is still not freed (the *term routines in proc need to
  be changed as well); Pexec() flag 6 supported. I did not test on Fastram but
  all of autoexec, EmuCON, loading progs from C: and A: work. (LVL)

  more trash on the screen - the size is set to 640x480 (joy)
