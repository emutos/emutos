 *  2) to put it out of the way of any old games that might clobber the

 * OSHEADER. However, by mistake GFA Basic only reads the low word of
 * that pointer, and sign-extends it to get the whole address.
 * Consequently, this can only be correct if shifty is located in the
 * first 32K of memory.
 * TOS puts this variable in a region accessible in user mode, so we
